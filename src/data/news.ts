A key feature of the FTA is the removal of tariff barriers on 90 per cent of tariff lines and opening up nearly 100 per cent of trade value.

With over 8,800 DPIIT-recognised startups, the state showcases a dynamic and expanding ecosystem contributing to economic diversification and job creation. A particularly encouraging trend is the strong representation of women entrepreneurs – over 45 per cent of startups in Haryana are led by women.

A group of women, once confined to their homes despite their education, have emerged as agri-entrepreneurs, transforming not only their own lives but also helping their communities adapt to the growing threats of climate change. Each agri-entrepreneur (AE) works with at least 150-200 small and marginal farmers, who are hit the most by these worsening climate challenges. They provide solutions to farmers on irrigation, provide climate-resilient seeds, help out with crop diversification, and act as a helpdesk for digital work—essentially a one-stop centre for all problems they may encounter. <a href=\"https:\/\/theprint.in\/india\/homemakers-to-changemakers-women-entrepreneurs-help-empower-rural-bihar-against-climate-challenges\/2507960\/\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Minister of State in the Finance Ministry, Pankaj Chaudhary, revealed that 39,643 loans were sanctioned in FY24, marginally lower than the 39,907 loans sanctioned in FY23. This figure, however, represents a significant 100 per cent increase from the 19,749 loans sanctioned in FY22. Despite the flat growth in sanctions, the scheme witnessed a decline in loan disbursements. In FY24, 17,374 loans were disbursed, marking a 12 per cent decrease from 19,872 in FY23. For comparison, 12,259 loans were disbursed in FY22. Launched in 2016, Stand Up India facilitates credit ranging from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore for first-time ventures in manufacturing, services, agri-allied activities, or the trading sector. The scheme mandates that each bank branch provide loans to at least one SC or ST borrower and one woman borrower. As per the scheme's website, a total of Rs 62,390 crore in loans has been sanctioned to date, with Rs 54,972 crore disbursed.

The 'India Employment Outlook 2030' report by Observer Research Foundation explored trends across India's job market at a time of geopolitical churn, supply chain disruptions, and a decline in manufacturing but an explosion of services. India's economy could touch $5 trillion by 2026-7, driven by the pool of human capital that its young population represents, and undergirded by robust public investment and private consumption, contends the report. The burgeoning service sector also offers encouraging avenues for women's employment. Hence, investing in women's skilling, financial inclusion, and entrepreneurship needs to be prioritised further, argues the report. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.in\/india\/news\/employment-could-rise-by-22-by-2028-as-india-targets-5-trillion-economy-goal-employment-outlook-report\/articleshow\/109340060.cms\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

This is a result of a combination of various factors, including social biases and infrastructural failures, which have held women back over the years. Notably, there has been a marked improvement in women’s participation in the workforce over the past several years.  In the last three decades, women’s formal labour participation in India has fallen to 20% in 2019 from around 25% in 1990. In order to efficiently bridge this consistent gender gap and support women in entering and succeeding in the workforce as professionals and entrepreneurs, several strategies can be adopted.

However, while their presence is significant, there is untapped potential for greater economic impact. Recent data from the Udyam Registration Portal revealed in Rajya Sabha insights into the landscape of women-owned MSMEs. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka emerge as frontrunners, hosting the highest number of such enterprises. This concentration underscores regional disparities and points towards opportunities for targeted interventions. Interestingly, while Maharashtra leads in sheer numbers, Tamil Nadu stands out for its higher employment contribution, suggesting a potential efficiency in job creation within its women-owned MSMEs. Delving deeper, informal Micro Enterprises (IMEs) registered through the Udyam Assist Platform reveal an even more pronounced presence of women entrepreneurs, constituting a significant 70.49 per cent. <a href=\"https:\/\/knnindia.co.in\/news\/newsdetails\/msme\/number-of-women-led-registered-msmes-in-india-double-to-205\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

For Indian startups, 2023 had been a challenging year as overall funding hit a seven-year low, tumbling to the levels of 2017. As capital dried up across sectors and genres irrespective of funding stages, many women-led startups failed to attract venture capital despite the big strides made towards gender inclusivity. India is not the lone sufferer. Globally, too, female founders lacked the much-needed financial backing from investors due to gender-based stereotypes and a limited number of iconic role models. According to PitchBook-NVCA Venture Monitor, U.S. startups with at least one female founder bagged 26.1% of the VC pot in 2023, while all-women founding teams secured less than 2% (1.8%, to be precise) of the total deal value in the same year. Even in 2021, a year flush with VC money, female-led startups in the EU barely raised 2% of the funding, per a Reuters report. <a href=\"https:\/\/inc42.com\/buzz\/women-tech-startup-funding-tanks-80-in-2023-but-is-all-hope-lost\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Two weeks later, scores of people throng the weekly Haat every Sunday afternoon at Senpara grounds of Debram village, a small hamlet barely 10 km from Agartala city. <a href=\"https:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/north-east-india\/tripura\/tripuras-weekly-sanskritik-haat-turns-a-hit-brings-smiles-on-rural-women-entrepreneurs-9082054\/\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Narayana Murthy has suggested greater focus on STEM areas (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) for speeding up the country’s march to become a developed nation by 2047, the Narendra Modi government seems to have pressed the pedal to increase women participation in these fields. Taking a cue from Japanese efforts to raise the level of participation of women in STEM fields, the Department of Science and Technology has turned its focus towards encouraging women to continue in the field even after marriage, said an official, pointing to efforts to improve gender parity in science and technology R&amp;D at the institutional level. In Japan there is a stigma that women who are successful in STEM fields are less likely to find husbands. This is because STEM careers are often seen as demanding and time-consuming, which leaves less time for dating and family. As a result of this, the country has been facing a challenge in maintaining a healthy participation of women in these fields. <a href=\"https:\/\/sundayguardianlive.com\/top-five\/efforts-on-to-address-underrepresentation-of-women-in-stem-areas\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Growing a wider variety of crops brings environmental benefits, improving soil fertility and reducing the threat from pests and crop diseases. The resultant crop diversity also enables farmers to adapt more readily to market changes, and builds resilience against increasingly erratic weather patterns, researchers say. The team says these findings suggest a pathway to improving global food supply, protecting the world’s low-income farming communities, whilst supporting women’s rights. <a href=\"https:\/\/indiaeducationdiary.in\/research-suggests-involving-women-in-agriculture-leads-to-greater-crop-diversity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read more<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

What are the celebrations on Children's Day? We are familiar with this, as we witness very year, celebrations across various educational forums and many motivational events that are also organised for children, all across the country.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fondly known as “Chacha Nehru” among children, the former Indian PM advocated an<br>enterprising education system for all children, as he considered children as the real strength of a nation and the very foundation of our society. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Celebrating kidpreneurs<br>On this day, we point out that many young entrepreneurs – ‘kidpreneurs’ are making a big<br>difference in our country today. Seriously, it seems that age is no barrier - to embark on<br>something really out-of-the-box. We are now discussing the kids who are running startups in<br>India, and quite successfully. They have stepped out, to break the stereotypes and have carved<br>out unique startups of their own. In other words, it seems the potential is there, which actually<br>moulds children to grow into kidpreneurs.<br>Meet Divya Gandotra Tandon, Founder &amp; Director: Scoop Beats Pvt. Ltd. She entered the<br>business world as a YouTuber, when her interest in technology pushed her to uploading and<br>reviewing videos on her YouTube account - to help people understand what they are<br>purchasing. She founded TheScoopBeats, a news and media organisation, after realising she<br>could do more in terms of giving the proper information to her fans. Boasting of 90,000+<br>followers on social media, she is now a full-fledged Instagram influencer with over 20,000<br>followers. While she chases her ambition, she has grown to be a multi-talented young female<br>entrepreneur in India, and her experience spans across domains like celebrity management,<br>social media management, and more.<br>Sreelakshmi Suresh, Founder, eDesign, TinyLogo is another example. She runs her<br>start-up and is a young web designer and CEO. She has bagged many national and<br>international awards too. Incidentally, she started climbing the success ladder at the tender age<br>of 10, by establishing her own venture called eDesign Technologies. Basically, this website<br>company offers services like website design, website development, SEO and logo<br>designing. She has moved ahead and has developed over 100 websites for organizations<br>across India. It’s difficult to imagine – but when she was in 4th grade, she was entrusted with<br>the work of developing a website for her school!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Toeing the line, is Aahana Jain, Founder of DOMA. She is in her teens and it was during the<br>COVID phase that she initiated her start-up, which is in the business of producing double-sided<br>masks. Aahana saw the struggle young children faced while wearing ill-fitting masks during the<br>global pandemic. She immediately saw it as an opportunity - to start a business by making<br>masks specially made for children.<br>Watching their trail, we can see that how they are determined to succeed. Here’s wishing them<br>all the best on this auspicious day!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

How can you reduce stress?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Women entrepreneurs can significantly reduce stress by using the practices of yoga and mindfulness. One glaring fact is that both meditation and yoga give you peace of mind and encourage you to be mindful. Most of our busy, modern lives are pretty distracting and tense. These two practices can actually help you slow down and be in the present. And, both yoga and meditation can support your well-being. Most people report feeling more balanced and uplifted after both activities.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The workplace, these days, has become most stressful; the fiercely competitive environment in the business universe, coupled with the pressure to meet deadlines keeps people busy on their toes. Moreover, people are working round the clock, especially now in the WFH mode. This builds up stress and has a direct impact on the productivity of teams and, consequently affects the ROI of the organization.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>How can Yoga &amp; Meditation help?<\/h2>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's great to do a yoga routine before or after work and stretch breaks are especially important and helpful for people who sit at a desk in front of a computer for long hours. It can result in back pain and neck pain. Just taking a few minutes to do stretches at your desk can relieve stress, increase productivity, and most importantly, makes you feel better.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yoga and meditation actually improve cardiovascular health, lower blood pressure and heart rate too. Meditating one time a day for ten minutes can help you relax, reduce stress hormones, lower your blood pressure, and allow for better blood flow.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>&gt; Stress Buster<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Stress affects our minds and bodies in many more ways than we can even imagine. A short time – a few minutes of daily yoga can help you release stress and be much more productive too.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>> Treats Back Pain, help with Asthma, and Improves Digestion<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Doing a few yoga poses throughout the week can help with chronic back pain. If you suffer from asthma, then “pranayam” focuses on breathing techniques that have shown to be especially effective against asthma. There are many yoga poses that help your digestive system. Yoga also stimulates the lymphatic system that helps flush out toxins, making your body cleaner. Meditation can also help address symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Irritable Bowel Disease (IBD) by reducing the frequency of stress-related flare-ups.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>&gt; Sleep better<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In order to live a healthy, balanced lifestyle - you need to get enough rest so you can function better the next day.

Studies have shown that yoga and meditation aid with mood swings, depression, and anxiety. Practicing yoga in a group setting also stimulates the production of oxytocin, which is the love hormone, and it also produces higher serotonin levels, which is the ‘happy’ hormone.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>&gt; Mental Clarity<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A healthy dose of yoga and meditation will keep your brain sharp and clear. Simple yoga practices and breathing techniques allow you to free your mind from the “clutter” that hits you. Slow breathing and yoga poses will help your memory and keep your thoughts more organized, once you get rid of stress, anxiety, and negative thinking.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>&gt; Increases Focus<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By being present “in the moment” you will learn to control your mind. This will help you to focus on tasks at hand. A vitally useful skill to have in a fast-paced workplace where multitasking is a way of life.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>&gt; Boosts Immunity<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yoga activates your immune system, gets your blood flowing and stimulates your lymphatic system. Yoga also supports healthy bones through weight-bearing exercises. That’s a lot of health benefits that lead to less sick days and higher performance amongst teams.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>&gt; Improves Posture<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sitting all day wreaks havoc on your posture. A huge benefit of yoga is finding the natural curves of the spine. Yoga also stretches major muscles and increases joint mobility to prevent joint aches and stiffness.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>&gt; Increases Energy<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What exercise does is that it increases your energy. The less active you are, the quicker fatigue hits you, and you will find that you tire out with lesser energy to tackle anything. Taking time to focus on yourself, even if it is for a short period, is just the mantra to tackle the rest of your day with vigour.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>People connect, bond better due to better clarity, proper understanding and effective communication can lead to improved productivity at work.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

But, how can we become environment-<br>friendly and take measures every day? Thankfully, today there is a day dedicated to this<br>issue, so that the world can take cognizance and take action.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>Tracing the background, the first World Environment Day was celebrated in<br>Washington. And, every year on June 5 the celebration is aimed at raising awareness<br>about the need to protect the environment. This year, World Environment Day 2022 is<br>hosted by Sweden. “Only One Earth\" is the campaign slogan, with the focus on “Living<br>Sustainably in Harmony with Nature”. This puts the spotlight on living sustainably -<br>which is in total harmony with nature.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>The World Environment Day initiative is the biggest international day for the<br>environment arena, and is led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).<br>It has been held annually since 1973, and it has grown to be the largest global platform<br>for environmental outreach. It is recognized and celebrated by millions of people across<br>the globe.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br><strong>“Sustainability” is key<\/strong><br>With the world, reeling under the prolonged spell of global warming, the topic of<br>“Sustainability” has gained immense importance and attention, unlike sometime ago.<br>Climate change has really hit us now and how! With the effects of climate change<br>becoming very obvious, being sustainable has been elevated to become more of a<br>norm than just a lifestyle. And, women have been acknowledged leaders of running<br>sustainable lifestyles at home. Today, the reality is that as women are getting<br>empowered in every step, many of them have carried over this thought process into<br>businesses.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>Women entrepreneurs are leading the sustainability charge in business and investing,<br>which is not surprising. According to a study by the National Sample Survey<br>Organisation, 14% of businesses in India are run by women. And many are driving the sustainability agenda in various sectors such as textiles, cosmetics, healthcare, and<br>food and beverages.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>As per the new 2020 BNP Paribas Global Entrepreneur Report, 54 percent of women<br>entrepreneurs say that beyond financial returns, reducing their carbon footprint is their<br>top measure of success in investing, compared to just 41 percent of men.<br>So, with women who have options to start a business and drive change, they are indeed<br>focused on protecting the future. And, subsequently, they seem to look at investment<br>and creation of businesses as factors that go beyond just ‘return on investment’. It<br>seems easier for women to understand that added to this, there can be a ‘social’ return<br>too.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>Most significantly, women tend to take a very practical approach to sustainability, both<br>in business and in their personal lives. A 2020 survey discovered that women are far<br>more likely to be conscious consumers than men - 63 percent of women think about<br>sustainability when shopping, compared to 50 percent of men. The emerging trend is<br>that they’re just more willing to make lifestyle changes for - a healthier economy, a<br>healthier planet and to reduce poverty. Incidentally, this translates into ‘environmentally<br>friendly’ behavior in their business lives, like focusing on reducing plastics.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>For sure, it is a clear indication of women’s general concerns - for the future.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br><strong>Building “eco-friendly” products and companies<\/strong><br>Many companies which make organic, eco-friendly, and sustainable products, are run<br>by women in India. But, it is not just cosmetics and textiles where women entrepreneurs<br>are operating on an eco-friendly basis. Most importantly, there are women who have<br>even founded and are running companies that help in making “green” buildings by using<br>agri-products. A fine example is Shriti Pandey who founded Strawcture, in 2018. A civil<br>engineer, she finished her masters in construction engineering from New York<br>University in 2016 and worked in the construction space too, after which she quit her job<br>for a rural fellowship in India. This lead her on to notice stubble-burning in a tribal<br>village of Madhya Pradesh and finding solutions.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>She set up her “green” business, but one of key challenges as an entrepreneur in this<br>sector is the price point. Creating eco-friendly, sustainable products require better<br>ingredients, more time to prepare and a totally different manufacturing mechanism. This<br>makes the process more expensive and so the product is also priced higher. The<br>products created her company are long lasting and free of toxins and plastic. But<br>convincing customers can be a pain point ! The company produces personal hygiene<br>products that are free of chemical and safe for the environment.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>Deepthi Ravula, CEO of WE HUB, a startup incubator for women entrepreneurs, points<br>out that in sustainable-product manufacturing, everything is expensive - raw materials,<br>technology, machinery. A behaviour change is required is what she feels, even though there has been a growing awareness about sustainable lifestyle and people are not<br>aware of the sustainable issues and how it will directly impact them; and subsequently,<br>any sustainable product or solution is regarded as an extra utility and not a necessity.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br><strong>Promising future<\/strong><br>Fortunately, hard work and persistence have helped women bring in some changes in<br>customer behaviour too. And with more people starting to see value in sustainability,<br>and the growing awareness among consumers – the road ahead looks positive indeed!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Women across all segments, be it entrepreneurs or retail customers, face multiple barriers in accessing finance in an equitable manner. These are spread across legal, socio-cultural and infrastructural barriers such as restricted mobility, lack of traditional collateral, lower ownership of mobile phones and access to internet, lower financial literacy levels, to name a few. Research suggests that the business case for a financial institution to serve women customers is strong and adding a gender lens to existing laws and financial products is crucial. For instance, the unmet credit gap for women-owned enterprises is 70.37 per cent, which translates to a financing gap of Rs 1.37 lakh crore and presents a huge market opportunity for financial institutions. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/theprint.in\/opinion\/indian-law-needs-to-account-for-women-make-finance-inclusive\/958165\/\" target=\"_blank\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Firstly, it does wonders for the family, financially. If the woman is a micro-entrepreneur, the impact does not end here. It <strong>changes mindsets and perspectives<\/strong> about her within the family and across the community. Samina, a beautician, who resides in Mumbai’s Kurla suburb realised this during the lockdown that began in late March 2020. Her family includes her husband and three children. When her husband lost his job, the family of five was left with no income for months. Samina also could not support her family as she did not have the products and resources to serve her clients. She received support in the form of a ‘Saksham’ kit with all the products she needed to restart her small business, which eventually was enough to support the family. Today, her husband encourages her to focus on her work as a beautician, and has willingly taken on the household chores. In fact, Samina’s father who was never in favour of her doing this business is now happy that his daughter is able to earn a livelihood. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/yourstory.com\/socialstory\/2022\/05\/how-project-saksham-is-aiming-to-empower-50-000-women\/amp\" target=\"_blank\">Read More<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Quantity has overpowered the desire for quality, leading to worries, dissatisfactions and unhappiness. From work related stress to family worries, the list is never-ending! Unfortunately, all of this has given rise to emotions like anger and sadness which are increasingly becoming a default way to be for a lot of us.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, now, with our world facing unprecedented challenges, wellbeing, both, physical as well as mental, matters more than ever. As we continue to respond to the Covid pandemic, it is imperative that we take action in the right direction to ‘Build Back Better and Happier’. Today, people’s overall wellbeing should be our top priority especially the happiness of entrepreneurs – the backbone of the economy!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Under these circumstances, we welcome 20 March as &nbsp;the day the world comes together to recognize the importance of happiness in our lives. In fact, we celebrate it to appreciate the work done by the United Nations and its partner nonprofit group Action for Happiness, which is composed of people from 160 countries. The ultimate goal of the movement is to spread awareness that progress is not only about increasing bottom lines and encouraging economic growth, but well-being and human happiness as well. In 2011, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution that made it a “fundamental human goal” to give happiness as much priority as economic opportunity. Two years later, in 2013, all 193 member states of the UN celebrated the world’s first International Day of Happiness, and it has continued to grow since.<\/li><li>The importance of celebrating small wins<\/li><li>According to Dr. Timothy A. Pychyl, “Progress on our goals makes us feel happier and more satisfied with life.” Hence you must not ignore small victories – no matter how small the victory, the joy of winning will certainly be immeasurable.<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When pausing to celebrate a small victory — for instance, clearing 20 emails from your inbox, even when there are 200 still to go — reminds you that you’re making progress, and progress feels good. Furthermore, it motives&nbsp; you and makes you more confident in your endeavours. So, celebrate the small wins too along the way and be happy NOW instead of waiting to ‘catch a big fish’ and be happy.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Though the following list is not an exhaustive one, I can suggest some ways to celebrate happiness day and be happy!<\/li><li>Surround yourself with positivity. It's difficult to maintain a happy mood if you're surrounded by negativity, especially in your work place. It can bring down productivity levels sharply.<\/li><li>Create a joy list and indulge in all that makes you happy.<\/li><li>If you are a nature-lover spend time amidst nature. If you have meetings lined up, hold them in your garden…why not?<\/li><li>Do something kind for someone else. Acts of kindness are often under-valued. Trust me, they can bring you immense joy! Also, it can be a part of your company’s CSR or a personal endeavor!<\/li><li>Focus on gratitude. Count your blessings\/victories, both, big and small and be thankful!<\/li><li>Learn a new happiness tool – cultivate a new hobby (even busy entrepreneurs need time off to unwind!)<\/li><li>Host a ‘Happiness Day’ meal not only on International Day of Happiness, but whenever you wish to! It has been proved that spending time with family and friends can take your happiness quotient to another level altogether!<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, if you're happy and you know it, celebrate it on International Day of Happiness on March 20! It is indeed a day to cheer up and appreciate the good things and silver linings in life, and here is your mission this for this week (and ahead): Be on the lookout for the little victories and be happy!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Women in our country have a critical role to play in converting our economy into a $5 trillion economy, yet despite their potential, women often struggle to join the workforce and contribute to the economy. Women in our country are capable of wearing any hat, and it is now critical for all of us to ensure that they get all of the opportunities that they deserve.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The panel discussion on 'building gender equal spaces: from policy to practise' was another intriguing activity held during this one-of-a-kind event.

Prof. Nandini Trivedi of Ohio State University USA spoke about the contemporary subjects of quantum information interspersed with her own experience of facing and overcoming difficulties as a woman scientist to pursue a research career. Prof. Margarida Telo Da Gama of the University of Lisbon in Portugal spoke about gender bias and other problems in academic leadership roles around the world.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The theme of this year's International Women's Day was based on UN’s narrative \"Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow\".

In fact, going by current trends, India should have more than 200 unicorns (startups with at least $1 billion valuation) by 2025, many of them going public, but this growth story will be primarily led by men.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Interestingly, the report, based on a survey of 2,000 women across India including women professionals, students, start-up founders and business leaders, highlights that almost 48% of women in non-metros are eager to take up tech entrepreneurship as a career option vis-à-vis 23% in metros who’d like to pursue their own ventures. Women in metros often prefer opting for corporate jobs as a convenient career choice. The report aims to bring to light the challenges and opportunities India presents a woman entrepreneur in technology as the nation becomes home to the world’s third-largest start-up ecosystem.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Key Highlights of the Report:<\/strong> <strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are five major barriers for women to take up entrepreneurship.

Amongst women in metros, 38% of the respondents felt that access to capital in metros is one of the major barriers to taking up entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Lack of infrastructure-. <\/strong>73% of women in non-metros feel that the non-availability of adequate infrastructure deters their move in taking up entrepreneurship. While 22% of women in metros feel that physical infrastructure is a problem for them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Lack of mentorship-<\/strong> 67% of women in non-metros adjourn lack of mentorship as another crucial factor in taking up entrepreneurship. 34% of women in metros also feel that mentorship is important and without a guiding light, it becomes difficult for them to shine.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Lack of Talent: <\/strong>Although women from non-metros are inclined towards starting off on their own, finding the right skill set in smaller cities hinders their progress. 48% of non-metro respondents have attributed lack of skilled and talented team often stops them to pursue entrepreneurship in comparison to women from metros where 18% feel that finding the right talent isn’t a hindrance.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Access to Technology: <\/strong>Despite an increasingly educated population, limited access to relevant business and technical resources is a major impediment in scaling the venture, with 74% of respondents from non-metros attributing lack of technology as the primary challenge. 24% of women in metros also opine that technology access is imperative for women entrepreneurs which can make or break their venture.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unveiling the report, <strong>Ruby Sinha, Founder, Sheatwork<\/strong> said, “<em>Women shouldn’t merely be consumers of tech but be creators of tech-driven products\/platforms. It is for all stakeholders including venture investors, mentors and society at large to ensure that the startup ecosystem especially in the technology space is rich with diversity – not just of ideas but even more women turning entrepreneurs to ensure all round growth of the startup ecosystem.”<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Faisal Kawoosa, Chief Analyst &amp; Founder, Techarc<\/strong><em> <\/em>further added<em>, “It is the first time that India has more women than men on record as per the recent data released by the National Family and Health Survey.

    "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>On World Mother Language Day, 21 February 2022, Sheatwork puts the spotlight on the impact of conducting entrepreneurial education in the mother tongue<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is a variety of languages that holds sway across different geographies globally – the languages we speak, read, write and teach. The English language had an edge, but the strength and viability of communicating in the mother language at home, at work, at schools and colleges have been examined and set to practice too.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, it was significant that on 17 November 1999, the 30th General Assembly of UNESCO unanimously decided that \"21st February be proclaimed International Mother Language Day throughout the world to commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed their lives on this very day in 1952.\" Subsequently, it was on May 16, 2007, that the United Nations General Assembly called upon member states \"to promote the preservation and protection of all languages used by peoples of the world\". By the same resolution, they proclaimed 2008 as the International Year of Languages, to “promote unity in diversity and international understanding, through multilingualism and multiculturalism.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In our country too, basically, to promote linguistic, cultural diversity and multilingualism around the world, International Mother Language Day or Matribhasha Diwas is observed every year on February 21. Interestingly, last year on this day, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu greeted the nation in different Indian languages, and he posted on social media - “My greetings on International #MotherLanguageDay. Linguistic diversity has always been one of the foundational pillars of our civilization. More than just a means of communication, our mother languages connect us with our heritage and define our socio-cultural identity”.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Education in the first language or mother tongue<\/strong><br><br>According to UNESCO, they “believe education, based on the first language or mother tongue, must begin from the early years as early childhood care and education is the foundation of learning”.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>40% of the world's inhabitants do not have access to education in the language they speak or understand best, and it hampers their learning, as well as their access to heritage and cultural expressions. So, it is critical that education be brought within their reach. In India, which has a rich variety of languages across the states, education is conducted majorly in English in urban areas. The question of conducting education in regional languages has been debated upon; and, interestingly conducting IITs and IIMs in regional languages has also come up for debate.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today, since India is the hub of startups, it makes sense to spread education targeted at budding entrepreneurs.   <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Understanding entrepreneurial education<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What is entrepreneurial education? Entrepreneurship education has been defined as “a collection of formalized teachings that informs, trains, and educates anyone interested in participating in socio-economic development through a project to promote entrepreneurship awareness, business creation, or small business development”.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The role of entrepreneurial education - to give a boost to business<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Specifically, entrepreneurial education focuses on those who have the intention of taking up a project, having identified a viable business opportunity. They also would have taken specific steps to start their venture.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unemployment is a reality today and it is of universal concern too, (of all developed and developing countries). Many policies and strategies have emerged worldwide to reduce unemployment; and notably, among the best alternative to the unemployment problem is – entrepreneurship. Plus entrepreneurship has come up as a significant generator of economic growth, innovation and creation of jobs too.  But, entrepreneurship development remains a challenge worldwide.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Significantly, one of the strategies to promote entrepreneurship is - to provide entrepreneurship education to the people to give a thrust to entrepreneurship.  Entrepreneurship education equips students with the motivation, knowledge and skills that are essential for launching a successful venture.  Coming down to the details, the purpose of entrepreneurship education is to train students to acquire skills, ideas and managerial abilities; and it also brings in the concept of self-employment rather than being employed for a salary. Another objective is to help students to consider business as a career and develop a positive attitude toward entrepreneurship<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, it is essential to have the infrastructure required to facilitate an entrepreneurial mindset and encourage self-employment. Most importantly, having a culture of creating new enterprises - is a critical aspect of this infrastructure, as it will encourage students to take up the risk of starting a business, on their own.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Various ministries and other organisations organise different events on this day, to raise awareness about inequalities faced by girls and the importance of their empowerment.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Celebrating National Girl Child Day today, (January 24, 2022) is indeed, very significant. Interestingly, as we look at driving gender equality and improving the status of girls it is equally critical to understand the importance of investing in young women’s economic empowerment and skills development. And, what better contribution than getting young women to be financially independent! In fact, if they can start and run their own businesses they can reach any heights of success!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Celebrating the girl child<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Celebrating the girl child on National Girl Child Day is actually opens up opportunities for Indian girls. We know that in India, unfortunately, gender inequality is one of the major issues that need focus. At this point, we remember what Malala Yousafzai said -&nbsp; “We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back. We call upon our sisters around the world to be brave – to embrace the strength within themselves and realise their full potential.\" So, it does appear that we need to focus on this and arrive at solutions.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Initiated in 2008 by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, the&nbsp; National Girl Child Day has underlined the main objective as – to highlight the inequalities faced by girls, to increase the consciousness of the people and offer new opportunities to the girl child in the society; to remove all inequalities to promote awareness - including the rights of a girl child; to ensure that the girl child should avail of all human rights, respect and value in the country; and to work on gender discrimination and educate people.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Educating girls &amp; honing their entrepreneurial skills<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What can be done to enhance the independence of girls and their entrepreneurial skills? The first thing that can be - to refine their interpersonal skills. Teach them to be confident, friendly and approachable, consistently, and encourage them to practice these things daily, so that it becomes a habit.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Secondly, when they decide to become business leaders, they should connect with other entrepreneurs. Networking is really crucial. Social platforms like Twitter is a great place to start. They can create lists (with hashtags) on relevant topics relevant, create another list with the top entrepreneurs you admire, or one focusing on competitors; or, they can join an entrepreneur organization. This way, you can often connect with fellow entrepreneurs at the same stage in their work, who may even be trying to solve the same problems. A quick internet search is all it takes to get started!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, joining communities in your industry is a great tip. All social media platforms are different. So, your content strategy also should suit the platform. You can build communities. If there isn’t a community yet you could always start one. Volunteering to lead it, whether that’s a monthly meetup, or an online thing is a sure-fire way to learn quickly.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Ultimately, <\/em><\/strong>the long-term benefits of educating the girls and making them independent can only lead to enhanced economic development. Plus, this can lead to ensuring education for the next generation too. Thus, girls pass on multiplying benefits.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Educating girls is pivotal to the development of a balanced and forward-looking society. and, is true, a uniquely positive force for the development of the society and the country, at large.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Today, the growing population, the fall in the number of job opportunities, coupled with the COVID induced stress on the Indian economy, make entrepreneurship even more pivotal for growth. For young individuals, it has become an alternative to satisfy their career needs and earn them a decent and much-wanted living. Seeing the situation of India’s developing economy, there is a dire need to come up with an alternative that would not only help fight the problems of unemployment but would also help the economy in strengthening its footing against the developed economies and become sustainable.  <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>India celebrates National Youth Day on January 12<\/strong>. This date was chosen to honour the birthday of Swami Vivekananda, one of India’s greatest spiritual and social leaders, who saw hope for the future in every child and believed that with “muscles of iron” and “nerves of steel” they could bring about social change. Swami himself personified the eternal energy of the youth and a restless quest for truth. <strong>This thought propagated by Swami, is extremely relevant today, as it proves that training the youth, especially to take up entrepreneurial activities is a golden opportunity to build the economy back better.<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Youth are undoubtedly, the backbone of a nation who through their energy and passion bring out the dramatic alterations in a nation and the way it functions<\/strong>. <strong>We are fortunate as today, almost 50 percent of India’s population is under the age of 25.<\/strong> The future of the country rides on their shoulders. <strong>Reminiscing the words of Franklin. D. Roosevelt, who said that we cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future, it is important that we strive to build back the economy through adequate skilling and education of the youth. In fact, proper entrepreneurial education, upskilling and right-skilling the youth should be a strategic twin priority for our nation, academia, and leadership alike.<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The effects of the pandemic, coupled with the rise of emerging technologies, have necessitated students to become skilled and adapt themselves to be productive, efficient, and relevant in the dynamic workplace of the future.

The process of entrepreneurship from the day of inception of the idea is a long one having its own share of problems and challenges. The lack of resources, knowledge, accurate information, legal complications and negative societal environment make the process more tedious and painful. These problems discourage many young individuals from taking up the opportunity due to fear of losing and falling into a financial crunch. To utilize their talent to the best, proper avenues and opportunities for entrepreneurial education, appropriate policy measures and motivation mechanisms are needed to channelize their energy in the right direction towards the right goal. Also, we must remember to sensitize them towards our collective needs and existence - thus, adding the much-needed humane touch, which will make our future entrepreneurs, true human-being first!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Dalai Lama – While educating the minds of our youth, we must not forget to educate their hearts.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

They say “laughter is the best medicine” and can give you the winning edge most of the time. In business too, it can play forward and can create magic.<\/strong> Significantly, there is a day devoted to laughter. <strong>World Laughter Day is celebrated on January 10<\/strong>, and it was first celebrated in 1998, in Mumbai, India, and the person behind it was Dr Madan Kataria, founder of the worldwide Laughter Yoga movement. Keeping in line with what Laughter Yoga promotes, “laughter is a positive and powerful emotion that has all the ingredients required for individuals to change themselves and to change the world in a peaceful and positive way”.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>World Laughter Day is celebrated all over the world. And it works towards promoting peace and love. People can come closer and it can only be spread through laughter and smiles.&nbsp; For wherever there is a smile, there is a little success too.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Various activities are organised every year on this day – like events woven around producing 1,000 red noses, decorating a ‘smiley’, giggle boxes, ‘funny’ literacy etc. In fact, every day must be a laughter day - for spreading smiles and happiness on the faces around. A day without laughter is a day wasted!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How laughter is really a critical positive need for entrepreneurs<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Laughter may sound like a minuscule thing and, often we may take it lightly. But, it is as beneficial to our health and well-being as it is to our social influence. Laughter is in fact, in our DNA; it's a universal common language, and easily recognised by all cultures.  Laughter provides many health benefits, unites us, creates social bonding, and, as many studies have revealed, it enhances morale, resilience, and effectiveness, all of which contributes not only to happy family life but also to a very productive work environment, leading to success.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, for people running small businesses, it is indeed, an essential item. In businesses, there is stress that exists and so there is a need to embrace a work-life balance. Stress is no stranger to entrepreneurs; we all have seen how laughter combats stress. A smile can work wonders! It can be the winning edge to the pattern of problems that we face in our work life. Entrepreneurs must also consider these benefits can steer a stress-free, successful trail that they can manage, as charismatic leaders.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>• <strong>Laughter can lead to powerful communication:<\/strong> Entrepreneurs as business leaders can creatively use laughter as a powerful form of communication. It can be carefully used as a tool to soften the impact of change which can be very hard-hitting, at times; it can build <em>camaraderie<\/em> within teams, and also heighten collaboration and bonding between the team members. It can point to a highly effective company culture (built upon humour and laughter), which in turn, can lead to record earnings and profitability.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Leaders who distance themselves from humour convey a ‘social distancing’. Moreover, today, with the vastly different needs and expectations of younger generations like Gen Z (and certainly a greater awareness and appreciation of emotional intelligence), the entrepreneur (and business heads like CEOs) play a new role in the company culture.<br>A good sense of humour factors in greatly.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>• Importance of laughter &amp; socialization for the entrepreneur (or the solo business owner): Isolation can become a part of the norm, especially for solo business owners. Whether introverted or extroverted, we are, by nature, social beings. So, socialization can create the ‘magic’ – to give a boost to the business.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is seen that lack of social interaction and laughter often can result in depression and low mental health that can point to low performance or a slump in success rates. Ironically, a study reveals that the prevalence of ‘stroke’ shows a 60 per cent increase in those who rarely laugh! So, the need is to get out of the office and get engaged in your social circles and take it in your stride on a happy note.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Laugh with your colleagues at work, and your social circles – it can really lead to more engaging and successful results!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

India, being an overall strong and developing country, with a young population that is rising to leadership and technology prowess which is driving growth and innovation, we are set to witness several business opportunities in multiple sectors in the coming year.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Businesses which care for the planet, people and profits equally - Social impact is becoming a priority in India as consumers are becoming increasingly aware about &nbsp;what they consume and how it has an effect on them and the earth. This is an opportunity for entrepreneurs to roll out a business idea which involves catering to the ‘needs’ of people and the planet while earning them profits. For example, fundraising money from various groups of investors to create a fund that will invest socially responsible and positive earth-impacting ventures is a good idea. Another great business idea is starting a solar energy set-up company.<\/li><li>Blockchain enabled businesses -With emerging technologies taking charge of how we operate in the ‘new normal’, it is wise to invest in businesses which revolve in and around them. The blockchain is a growing technology, and is going to become an essential part of the business in the Indian marketplace in the coming years. Our government has also set up support funds to help the development of technologies like this and the Internet of Things, leaving this business idea ripe for making money. For example, a blockchain tracking bank ledger would allow e-commerce store owners to track where their payments are coming from, verify they are secure, and be able to accept money faster. This would make money transactions transparent, thereby curbing fraudulent transactions.<\/li><li>Fitness Business - The wellness market is already a well-established one, with a market of more than $1.5 trillion worldwide and growing. Further, the pandemic has changed how people approach their fitness routines in a big way. As a result of reduced access to gyms, people discovered the upsides to working out from home.&nbsp; Research reports expect the home fitness market to reach $14.8 billion by 2027. Hence, gauging this, products&nbsp; that make home workouts more effective could be a promising opportunity for your new entrepreneurial venture. Also, health and wellness apps are becoming popular and have a huge market as well, with downloads growing by 46% worldwide at the beginning of 2020, according to the World Economic Forum. So, this could be a promising sector for you to launch your entrepreneurial pad.<\/li><li>Business which supports the hosting of digital events and conferences - The days of cobbling together an online event with Zoom calls (and technical difficulties) may soon be over. Virtual event hosting has become a full-on industry and one that will remain popular even after in-person events are fully reopened. Companies have discovered that moving events to a fully virtual or hybrid model opens up participation to many more people than would otherwise have access. This trend has created &nbsp;opportunities for rolling out services to support planning, hosting, and executing online events of all kinds.<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that you have these ideas, what are you waiting for? Get going and the world will be yours! Wishing all of you a very happy, healthy and prosperous 2022!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

And this ‘new normal’ is likely to become a part of daily life post-COVID; and attitude changes too, will welcome more women to take up entrepreneurship!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ushered in ‘remote’ startups acceptance<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unlike earlier conditions, while starting a business today, while launching one's business, questions about ‘physical’ office space do not come upfront! In the pre-COVID-19 era, people thought ‘Working From Home’ negated one's business credibility; besides, there existed an unconscious bias against women working from home<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The pandemic has turned the situation upside down! The time is never more suitable than now, for businesses to operate on a fully remote model. With global companies (small and big) working remotely, it has ushered in an acceptance of the ‘Work From Home’ model – which actually brightens up the scene for entrepreneurs. For, you can now run an entirely virtual business and a remote team located across geographies, that can be productive too.&nbsp; Professional networking, too, has turned virtual that happens on social media networks.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many leading companies have already announced their decision to follow a hybrid work culture and, some have insisted it will be their permanent work mode. A strong digital presence connects you with your professional network (and you need not worry about inviting clients to a physical office for meetings).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Integrated work-life balance<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>WFM evolved work-life balance with work-life ‘integration’. While the earlier scene was juggling personal and professional lives, now the pandemic had introduced a more holistic acceptance of professional domestic responsibilities of employees.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Plus it has put the spotlight on ‘empathy’. So, we find colleagues, bosses and clients, more empathetic towards the role women play in their lives (as mothers and caregivers). This has added a feather to the woman entrepreneur's professional capabilities, creating an encouraging environment that allows women to thrive and shine as entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Created a positive environment<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With more appreciation for the efforts that go into balancing household responsibilities and work, we have witnessed the woman as a successful mompreneur. Equally distributed domestic responsibilities have reduced the burden of expectations for women. Work from home also makes entrepreneurship more inclusive for mothers. Creating a positive environment.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>India’s efforts to bring in progress<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>India has witnessed huge reinforcement of the government’s commitment towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). NITI Aayog released an SDG Index 2020-21 to bring together the economic, social, and environmental pillars in the country, with a focus on their partnerships and collaborations. The commitment of the government, especially in SDG 5 i.e., Gender Equality, is a significant step towards achieving gender equality by ending all forms of discrimination and calls for valuing women’s unpaid care and domestic work amongst other things. Additionally, SDG 5 is interlinked to other SDGs such as End Poverty, Zero Hunger, Health for All, Quality Education, etc. With a score of 60 in the SDG Index 2021, India’s success in bringing about inclusive and sustainable growth is well on the move.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thus, the country’s initiatives and the ‘new normal’ that we have been introduced to, has broken down many barriers that existed for women entrepreneurs. The changes brought in by COVID-19 have not only transformed the business landscape but have created favourable circumstances for women entrepreneurs. The prospects of starting and running a business from anywhere, along with changing perceptions of women's responsibilities, have paved the way for women to step into the business world. But there is still a long way to go….<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, as we step into 2022, the scenario can only get better for women entrepreneurs to forge ahead!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

The longer we go without making significant changes, the greater the threat of global warming and climate change become to our daily lives!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>To make energy-saving a more conscious and deliberate effort, every year, India observes National Energy Conservation on December 14. The day is organized by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) – which operates under the Ministry of Power, aiming to present India’s stellar achievements in cost-efficient energy production and resource conservation. Further plans for the future are also discussed on this day, targeting holistic development as the main goal towards mitigation of climate change.<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When we showcase India's contribution to energy conservation and steps taken towards becoming an energy-efficient nation, we also simultaneously encourage more people to become energy savers. So, today, I take this opportunity to share tips to encourage entrepreneurs to make their business more sustainable and give back to the world as they continue to rise.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Respect the changing consumer sentiment -Faced with compounding environmental crises, consumers are starting to vote green with their wallets. Businesses of all shapes and sizes need to continually analyze consumer sentiment because as people learn more about climate change and its effects, they are changing their buying habits.<\/li><li>Offer remote work - As more work gets done online, there is less need for people to be in a physical office. The pandemic has accelerated remote working, thereby allowing employees to have work-life flexibility, substantially reducing their time spent commuting. This is a boon in disguise for the environment. Fewer cars on the road, equates to less traffic, which in turn equates to less carbon dioxide (CO2) being emitted into the air.<\/li><li>Use sustainable products- The items\/hardware companies purchase to ensure their workplaces function well can be detrimental to the health of the environment due to the processes that go into making them. All paper items commonly used, such as printer paper,&nbsp; should be&nbsp; made from post- or pre-consumer waste. Recycled products such as these maintain a circular economy and reduce overall waste.<\/li><li>Make energy-efficient upgrades to become sustainable - Becoming energy efficient doesn’t only help to shrink carbon footprints, it also helps to reduce a company’s energy bill. Many simple changes such as using &nbsp;energy-efficient appliances; moving to LED lights; automating lights with sensors; using smart thermostats; taking advantage of natural light; and supplying staff with energy efficient &nbsp;laptops instead of desktop computers, will certainly make your business more sustainable.<\/li><li>Do business with green businesses - Web hosting isn’t the only way businesses can go carbon-neutral with the companies they choose to operate with. From software companies and food and beverage brands to apparel labels and shipping carriers, carbon-neutral vendors can be found across every major industry. It is important to remember that, becoming a sustainable business also largely depends on the companies you support\/deal with.<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>So, come one, come all, to conserve energy and thus preserve the future!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Today, an encouraging environment is required to be formed to facilitate women to involve themselves energetically in entrepreneurial assignments.

And, with the advent of the pandemic, has accelerated the process. It actually highlights the digital revolution in today's times. So, knowledge of computers is very critical today, and it is required in all walks of life. Hence, to promote ‘computer’ awareness and to encourage people to use them efficiently, World Computer Literacy Day is a good occasion.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The day stands for promoting technological skills, especially in women and children. The World Computer Literacy Day aims to give them inspiration -  to learn more and make their work\/tasks easier with the use of computers. Plus, improving women's access to technologies can help raise their status in their communities; this, in turn, can lead to greater autonomy and access to information. And subsequently, it involves the power to advocate sustainable practices, and lower mortality rates during natural disasters. So, tech can be not only life-changing; it can be life-saving too!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Technological skills can be life-changing<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Computers are of utmost importance to human life. They should be equally accessible to people across the world so that they can reap the benefits and embellish their lives with the latest technology. But does this really happen?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Computer accessibility must also extend to rural areas. It is unfortunate that rural people around the world, despite contributing immensely to the global economy, face greater obstacles to sustainable development; and this also extends to their share of a decent quality of life than their urban counterparts. Rural women and girls, in particular, lack equal access to a number of critical essentials like public services, that includes education, health care, and infrastructure, as well as access to the internet and digital devices, and consequently, the skills needed to use them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today, we draw attention to the fact that globally, rural women should be given a chance so that they can fare equally with urban women; and efforts must be put in so that the poverty that they disproportionately experience, must also be mitigated.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Contributing to economic development<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The reality is that in the rural areas, women struggle really hard to maintain a balance in life. Rural women engage in both agricultural and economic activities - to ensure their families’ financial security by diversifying sources of income. Rural women today, share a significant contribution with men, as both agricultural and non-agricultural workforce of India.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With changes in rural settings, rural women are progressing slowly and swiftly in supporting their husbands for contributing to the household incomes. We find that in rural areas today, women stand shoulder-to-shoulder with men and are performing almost equally in work and economic development. As per statistics, around 37 per cent of rural women make purchases on their own, and these numbers are moving up to 40 per cent for working rural women.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today, with the winds of change set in, rural women in India are seen as significant agents for growth and development. They do play an important role in the attainment of transforming economic, educational, and social changes needed for sustainable development. And, what a better day to celebrate this, than today!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

    "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Women entrepreneurship in the limelight –<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Women entrepreneurship has recently received attention by the world and has begun to grab the lime-light, particularly because the global economic and social impact of female entrepreneurs is beginning to gain prominence. The number of women entrepreneurs particularly in advanced markets and economies is now growing rapidly. Yet, the growth rate of female entrepreneurship in developing nations is&nbsp; very low. What’s worse is that there exists a very limited literature acknowledging and addressing the challenges that lace the development of female entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;It is noteworthy that female entrepreneurship has&nbsp; received attention not only because it contributes to job creation and economic growth potential of a nation, but also because it presents a form of entrepreneurial diversity in an economy. Historically,&nbsp; women&nbsp; are&nbsp; mainly&nbsp; discriminated&nbsp; for&nbsp; their gender,&nbsp; regardless of&nbsp; culture, race,&nbsp; region,&nbsp; religion, and nationality. Majority of the contemporary societies are latently or manifestly patriarchal with men dominating in social, religious, political, and economic&nbsp; fields. Women are often&nbsp; sidelined and subject to&nbsp; domestic or&nbsp; weaker&nbsp; roles.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Deterrents to women entrepreneurship –<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From time immemorial, women have been the silent sufferers of societies worldwide. They are exposed to violence and deprivations which come in many forms for them; such as, social disconnection, debarment on&nbsp; the&nbsp; selection&nbsp; of&nbsp; profession,&nbsp; restrictions&nbsp; on&nbsp; freedom&nbsp; in&nbsp; reproductive&nbsp; health&nbsp; decision-making within a family, and a lesser or no role in entrepreneurship and wealth creation activities. Women's sufferings range from abuse, molestation, rape, malnutrition, domestic violence, slavery, restriction on free movement, and poverty; and these can nip the entrepreneurial dream of women, whether big or small, right in the bud!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Deleting the deterrents-<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Undeniably, violence&nbsp; limits&nbsp; women's&nbsp; contributions&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; socio-economic&nbsp; sphere&nbsp; and&nbsp; aggravates their physical, emotional,&nbsp; and social&nbsp; conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Such vulnerabilities tend to&nbsp; increase in&nbsp; the absence&nbsp; of their&nbsp; access to&nbsp; formal claim&nbsp; to education, land&nbsp; and property and even the daily basic necessities. This can harm the shaping of their entrepreneurial dreams. The impact of protection of&nbsp; property rights&nbsp; on&nbsp; women empowerment and reduction&nbsp; in&nbsp; violence&nbsp; against&nbsp; women,&nbsp; will certainly contribute&nbsp; towards&nbsp; a&nbsp; favorable entrepreneurial ecosystem. For example, having property rights which are acknowledged, earns women financial independence which in turn instils &nbsp;confidence in them to give their dreams wings. It also allows them access to the initial funding they might need to launch their business venture.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Understanding silence and erasing violence-<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While pervasive, gender-based violence is not inevitable. It can and must be prevented. Stopping this violence starts with paying heed to the silent sufferings of women and believing survivors. Adopting comprehensive and inclusive approaches that tackle the root causes and transforming harmful social norms, to empower women and girls is now imperative. With survivor-centred essential services across policing, justice, health, and social sectors, and sufficient financing for the women’s rights agenda, we can end gender-based violence.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This year's ‘International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women’, observed on 25<sup>th<\/sup> November, 2021, bears the theme, \"Orange the World: End Violence against Women Now<\/em>!\". Orange is our colour to represent a brighter future free of violence against women and girls. This day will also launch&nbsp; 16 days of activism to be concluded on the 10<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;of December 2020 — the day that commemorates the&nbsp;International Human Rights Day. <em>Come let us all be a part of this movement, more mentally if not physically and give respect to women which they rightfully deserve!<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

A large number of nations (144 nations overall) recognized the first WED in 2014, which included the presentation of the Women's Entrepreneurship Day Pioneer Awards. The idea behind was to celebrate, empower and support women entrepreneurs across the globe; and the immediate aim was to create awareness about 250 million women and girls living in poverty, who deserved to get opportunities in life; and to inspire and empower 4 billion women all over the globe. On this day, it is important to highlight achievements and focus on challenges faced by women in business.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we celebrate ‘World Entrepreneurs’ Day’ on November 19, it is imperative that we understand how women contribute to modern society. Launched by the United Nations (UN) to encourage and value women entrepreneurs, the date is truly a celebration.<br><br>Through the channels of time, women have shouldered family responsibilities like cooking, cleaning, child-rearing and more. Actually, they have been sculpting their strong personalities since time immemorial. Then women started to pursue careers, thereby providing financial support to their families, financial independence for self and also simultaneously contributing to the economic growth of the nation. And, according to the Sixth Economic Census, an estimated 13.5 million women-owned enterprises are creating direct employment for 27 million people.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, with women emerging as successful business leaders and entrepreneurs, it is a win-win situation for everyone. After all, women empowerment does affect the socio-economic situation of the country in positive ways! Time management skills and a passion to learn, a zeal to work have always been a woman’s strengths which help her to walk the line, balancing personal and professional fronts perfectly. &nbsp;It is pertinent to note that an empowered woman will lay the foundation for a progressive tomorrow.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Stepping on to entrepreneurship &amp; laying the foundation for tomorrow<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The success of a woman entrepreneur can be partially attributed to her family as well. As the ‘lady of the house’ steps into the role of an entrepreneur, it is her family who steps in equipped to handle all concerns when needed, in ‘her’ absence due to work-related issues. It is noteworthy how families play such a crucial role in women’s entrepreneurial experiences, not always as a source of restraints, obligations and duties but also as a source of resources and support.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Women have potential, and they will succeed. We have been seeing many women emerge in business. However, there’s a long way to go. Statistically, India, unfortunately, ranks a distant low at 70 among 77 countries in the Female Entrepreneurship Index by GEDI.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As women embark on their entrepreneurial endeavours, they will also need the support of their families and communities. To begin with, families should encourage women to dream big and create ideas to produce results. Providing the much-needed financial support for investing in her enterprise, can be a major hurdle removed from her path. In fact, families can experience the ultimate sense of belonging through the tender care of the ‘lady of the house’; and businesses, economy and societies can benefit hugely from these women when they step out in all dynamism and capability. Investing in women is good for all because when you invest in a woman, the profits are for everyone to share.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Undoubtedly, when inspiration and empowerment prop up women business leaders, the sky is the limit!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Extending sympathy and concern for the immense struggles of people confined to poverty, it gives them a voice and a chance to be heard. Poverty is the lowermost rung in the broad spectrum of life. It is indeed a violation of human rights, and there is an urgent need for people from across the globe to come together and ensure that these rights are respected. If a poverty-free world cannot be achieved, then it is very difficult to imagine the development of humankind!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The day was first commemorated in Paris, France, in 1987 at the Human Rights and Liberties Plaza at the Trocadéro to honor victims of poverty, hunger, violence, and fear. The event witnessed the unveiling of a commemorative stone by Joseph Wresinski, founder of the International Movement ATD Fourth World. Then, in 1992, the United Nations (UN) officially designated October 17 as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. So, from that time, this day is significant to raise awareness and to highlight the problems faced by poverty-stricken people and, the attempt is to work towards eradicating poverty globally in all its forms.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Entrepreneurship can save the day!<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Research has revealed that&nbsp;<strong>entrepreneurship increases the probability of coming out of poverty, and<\/strong> it ushers in the positive position of remaining above the poverty level. Significantly, the governments of different nations have a role to play here, for there are implications on how governments can work to address poverty, by creating an investment, insurance, and income stabilization schemes.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Why is the role of woman entrepreneur important?<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Women entrepreneurs<\/strong>&nbsp;<strong>account for improved economic growth and stability within a country<\/strong>. Moreover, women entrepreneurs inspire other women to start businesses.

They have the unique tendency to build and maintain long-term relationships too. Additionally, their fiscally-conservative approach reduces the risk of business failure. Women entrepreneur also account for improved economic growth and stability within a country.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>According to research, it has been observed that women are good entrepreneurs, as they can maintain work-balance in life. It is also observed that women entrepreneurs have proved to be a strong driving force in the corporate universe, today. They balance their duties of both motherhood and entrepreneurship very efficiently.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, well-educated, professionally-qualified women must be encouraged to set off on their own and manage their own business, rather than be employed in any office. The uncultivated talents of young women can be identified and trained for different industries - to increase the productivity in the industrial sector as well as the nation. This should be done not only in the metros, but in Tier 2 and 3 and other rural areas too. This is indeed, a sound and safe way to eradicate poverty too. And how!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

We are implementing one of the largest skilling machines in the world, and being closely associated with the industry and academia, MEPSC has been part of many forums which work on innovation and entrepreneurship at various levels; also the advent of the National Education Policy 2020 showed a focus on vocational education and its derivatives from Class VII onwards. We discussed and came up with this idea –which actually Shivani initiated. We had been trying to get around school and college students and “Catch them Young”, and we try to get the spirit of entrepreneurial mindset and critical thinking ability and to harness those cognitive skills among young minds.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, we conceptualised and started working on building the brand; and soon after that, we had a webinar for school and college students, and the whole idea was to work out a product that could act as a symposium of ideas, which could harness the spirit of innovation and nurture it to build on entrepreneurship. We then onboarded CBSC, IIMs, IITs and opportunities are coming up every day. We are reaching out to the youth of the country, from Class VI to Class XII to collect ideas that are workable and can be converted into ventures (and we want to collect 1 lakh ideas as we go along).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby: Could you talk about the Youth Ideathon and also your personal journeys into entrepreneurship?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shivani: <\/strong>It was an initiative based on my personal journey, and I’ve been fortunate to come from a family that was able to access the best of education and the opportunities that go with it. But, even then, I realised in my 30s that there is a huge gap in our education system. A lot of learning goes waste – we learn through subjects, assignments, which is the aim of the education system. When I started my journey as an entrepreneur, I realised that as humans, we have so much more potential. At the school level we are not harnessing that potential. In some ways, education opens up our minds but it is also limiting us. We are not able to connect what we are learning to what we can achieve. So, we think Startup was a genesis – had it happened while I was at school, I could have indeed, achieved more. There’s so much talent, so much potential and we are not harnessing that. We started at a grassroots level and work with students across the country – in Tier 1 &amp; 2 cities, and vilages; it’s two years now, and we tried to understand the problem. A lot of market education is required.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We both had a mental connect and we focussed on - could we energise the system to get school leaders, educationists, industry leaders, policymakers on board? Could we drive innovation and entrepreneurship at the school level?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby: How is the Ideathon happening? How are you and MEPSC collaborating to make this a success<\/strong>?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shivani:<\/strong> With MEPSC’s reach into government policymaking and our reach into the startup world – it has been a good tie-up to support this movement. To get it working we have a 6-week period and we have a portal called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youthideathon.in\">www.youthideathon.in<\/a>. Here there’s a lot of access to resources and through the month we have webinars for teachers, schools, students; and the idea is to have schools and students participating. Students had not been exposed to this before, so there’s an opening up of the child’s mind to think – “I am not part of a large eco-system but I am capable of changing things”. We find we have to do a bit of education and mentoring, and once students realise that they have the potential, we see very good ideas coming from them! This portal is open till October 24.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We’re enabling teachers and educational leaders to mentor students as well as ‘youth idea ambassadors’. Beyond that, we will be picking 500 most promising ideas and will conduct video interviews, which is really to see the passion! The Top 100 we will take into a mentored incubation process, the idea being to energise the system.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby: How is MEPSC working towards the goal of mass skilling and entrepreneurship in the country?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Col Pokhriyal: <\/strong>MEPSC has been relentlessly working towards contributing to the growth story of India through the Skill India Mission. Keeping in line with that objective, we have created national occupational standards essentially to inculcate the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation. We are trying to partner with multiple organisations and forums, where we are creating a mass movement to empower the youth, to become ‘solopreneurs’ with massive outreach through its qualifications, with minimum investment in the eco-system. Since we are partnered with various entrepreneurship forums, we have been actively creating platforms for the youth of the country to share their entrepreneurial journeys (especially the youth in a rural background). The movement tries to push various Government of India schemes like Start-Up India, Atmanirbhar Bharat, Make in India, Skill India – so that we have a very powerful system that can sustain the massive investment.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We’re trying to guide and mentor the youth, especially women, to come out with powerful ideas, which can go towards entrepreneurship. The idea and effort of MEPSC is to look for huge opportunities which can be created, when the ideas become sustainable. This is the transformable change we are trying to bring about - a change in the mindset of parents, teachers, students and society at large - that entrepreneurship is the way forward.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby: What has been the response now from students (especially the female students) and teachers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shivani:<\/strong> With the teachers we are receiving immense response, and I think they have realised that the system needs a shake-up! We have been oversubscribed too, as per the number of participants we can take.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Talking about the representation of girls in big cities, we find a good mix (60:40 in terms of girls who are interested). However, when you move away from cities, it is heart-breaking, as it is 80:20. I think conditioning is happening at many levels – at home, society. Another heart-breaking part was when we had an Entrepreneurship Hackathon in the rural areas, the ideas that came up were – women’s safety, access to education showing that there are issues girls in smaller towns are facing. We have to attack this at multiple levels, which is why “Youth Ideathon” should become a powerful changemaker!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby: Do you feel educational institutions are the foundation pillars to building a successful start-up ecosystem?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Col Pokhriyal: <\/strong>I am a firm believer of that. There are many examples. In recent times, in Delhi and many cities there was the Swachh Bharat Mission carried out by the government where teachers taught health and hygiene was the focus; then there were many other initiatives like  Say ‘No’ to Plastics, Pollution or Crackers, Plant MoreTrees etc. Teachers are the role models and parents also have a role; but I feel teachers have a bigger role, for whatever comes from the teachers’ mouth is taken as a gospel truth!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, I am 100% convinced that teachers and schools have a very important role to play for the betterment of society and the country at large.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby: Who are your partners who have come forward to join the “Youth Ideathon”?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shivani:<\/strong>  We had conceptualised the idea very fast, and on August 27 was the first webinar. Since then, the kind of partners that have come forward has been amazing. Of course, CBSC was a huge boost for us, at our innovation centres. Then we have incubation partners – IIT Roorkee, IIMs, and corporates like Bajaj Finance, Macmillan and many more. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We feel extremely energised with the nature of the scale of partnerships, and more are joining even now. We really see this movement picking up steam!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby: Do you feel women make better entrepreneurs with their multitasking abilities, from your experience<\/strong>?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shivani:<\/strong> I stay away from stereotyping. I feel every human is a great entrepreneur.&nbsp; I think life is a start-up. It’s not about men and women; women make good entrepreneurs, so do men. Through my own journey, I feel it is hugely ‘empowering’ – to be able to define your life on your terms.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And I am passionate about women entrepreneurs, I do support them and I am involved in a bit of angel investing.

The <strong>first<\/strong> <strong>International Day of Rural Women<\/strong> was observed on 15 October 2008, and it is purposely held the day before <strong>World Food Day<\/strong>, in order to highlight the role played by rural women in food production and food security!<\/li><li>Rural women - a quarter of the world’s population - work as farmers, wage earners, and entrepreneurs. <\/li><li>Less than 20% of landholders worldwide are women. In rural areas, the gender pay gap is as high as 40%<\/li><li>The International Labour Organization (ILO)’s Decent Work Agenda offers an integrated framework for rural women’s empowerment, underpinned by international labour standards, social dialogue and the recognition that rural women play a key role in climate action. <\/li><li><strong>The number in the last decade of women-owned businesses has increased from 14% to over 20% of the country. <\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Women and girls are disadvantaged in this pandemic, a problem aggravated in rural areas<\/strong>. Rural women, with a crucial role in agriculture, food security and nutrition, already face struggles in their daily lives. Now, since COVID-19 and their unique health needs in remote areas, they are more likely to have suffered intensely. Restrictive social norms and gender stereotypes have also limited rural women’s ability to break the glass ceiling and look beyond. Furthermore, a lot of rural women&nbsp;suffer from isolation, as well as the spread of misinformation, and a lack of access to critical technologies to improve their work and personal life.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Despite all of that, rural women have been at the front lines of responding to the pandemic even as their unpaid care and domestic work increased under lockdowns. It is time we celebrate the efforts of rural women and girls around the world who are attempting to shape a more equitable future and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic through their entrepreneurial ventures; and what better day to acknowledge this than 15th October, the International Day for Rural Women!<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Levelling the playing field and supporting women to start even small-scale enterprises can help in accelerating overall female entrepreneurship. With the new millennial, due to the strong globalization India, with a humongous population has, and is changing a lot. One of the most evident aspects of this change is visible thanks to the formal entrance of women into the business world. Today, villages are, day after day,  more connected to the fastest version of the internet, and with better services and improved living standards, the rural sector is fast gaining prominence in the business world.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Programs For Rural Women Entrepreneurs<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since the last part of the previous millennium, the Government of India has curated programs to promote, help and resolve poverty and work solutions. <strong>Pradhan Mantri Swarozgar Yojana, Udyogini Scheme, Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY) and Mahila Udyam Nidhi Scheme are a few of the programs which provide support in building the rural women entrepreneurship ecosystem.<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With innovative measures to provide loans, with longer terms and different kinds of requirements, these programs and many more, have helped a lot of women access funds, to develop new ideas or companies, or more simply to own new machines, new cars, new products. <br><br><strong>Another initiative that has helped a lot the developments, has been the training method, where several training options have been created to teach, form, and build knowledge and professions inside the women’s reality<\/strong>. Top government schemes to promote women education in India like, <strong>Support and Training and Employment Programme for Women (STEP), Mahila Shakti Kendra<\/strong>, which empowers rural women by educating them about digital literacy, employment opportunities, skill development, health, and nutrition <strong>also play a pivotal role in inculcating the ‘entrepreneurial mind-set’ amongst the rural women of our nation.<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Many inspirational women based in rural areas have overcome challenges<\/strong> and have carved a niche in the male-dominated sector of entrepreneurship. <strong>Anita Devi, the ‘Mushroom Lady Of Bihar’, Chetna Gala Sinmha, a social activist and woman entrepreneur who opened the first Bank for and by rural women with the name of Mann Deshi Mahila Sahakari Bank, Thinlas Choral an activist and entrepreneur from Ladakh, and Navalben Dalsangbhai Chaudhary, an entrepreneur whose business is based on milk usage, are some of the inspiring names of rural India<\/strong>. These names are enough to rekindle the fire of entreprenurship in you irrespective of where you are based. You too can succeed in your business ventures; all you need to do is have the right mindset, clarity of vision, and a determination to pass through every hurdle that comes your way!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

    "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was on September 18, 2020 that United Nations first celebrated Equal Pay Day. Most importantly, it aims at highlighting the importance of achieving equal pay globally (for work at the same level); and, as per the UN there is an existing gender pay gap estimated at 23 percent. So, the day is observed by the United Nations to highlight this issue and also to end discrimination against women and girls.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today the world is observing this day, to throw light on the importance of ending sexual discrimination, regarding gender pay gap. This year’s celebration will focus on the efforts of key labour market factors, to ensure that equal pay remains central to pandemic responses worldwide and also, to fully recognize the contributions of women to COVID-19 recovery. The occasion aims to achieve a united commitment to closing the gender pay gap across regions and sectors - to build ahead from the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>The key focus is that “equal pay for work of equal value” is a human right that must be made available to all women. In India, it is seen that women earn 19 per cent less than men. How can a country progress if almost half of its population is subjected to discrimination?<br>But there certain factors that point to keep the flag flying high for gender equality, as far as compensation for work is concerned.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>• Equal pay<\/strong>: a human right: Across the globe, it is a reality that women are paid less than men across the world. In India, the situation is grave. A survey by Monster Salary Index has revealed that women earn 19 per cent less than men.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is a glaring fact that gender pay gap persists. According to Statistics Canada, on average, full-time working women in Canada earn 32% less than men. This gap is wider for Indigenous women (35%), women with a disability (46%), and racialized women (33%). This gender pay gap primarily contributes to the existence of poverty in women’s lives.<br>In India, with women forming almost 50% of the population, this clearly points to the injustice meted out to nearly half of the Indian population. Actually, equal pay for equal work is a human right and all women are entitled to this. As a society, and as a nation, we should ensure that everyone gets equal treatment and any form of discrimination should not push anyone behind.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>• Role of women is indispensable<\/strong>: In the business world, the role of women has forged ahead and their presence is really creating ripples. Today, women business leaders and entrepreneurs are indeed grabbing the spotlight. To trace back in history, the Father of the Nation - Mahatma Gandhi, while fighting against the British, firmly believed that India cannot gain independence, if there is no emancipation of women and they are kept away from the freedom struggle. But, a reality check shows we still have a long way to go. Significantly, today, we are stepping ahead to become an economic superpower but, unfortunately, we forget that this cannot be achieved unless we achieve equal pay for equal work.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>• Impact of COVID-19 pandemic<\/strong>: The current pandemic has also had a gendered impact. According to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, 13% of all working women in Canada are at risk of layoff, compared to 9% of working men. Women in low-wage jobs are therefore, most at risk. This again displays the need for pay equity. It is imperative that a gender-based analysis be the focus of the government. Ultimately, the inclusion of women is critical at all levels of consultation and decision-making - to ensure that they are not left behind as a result of the pandemic.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>• Ensuring a brighter future<\/strong>: The presence of biases against the female gender continues to block the progress of many nations. It also limits women’s ability to gain economic stability and freedom. And researchers have found that this has a domino effect on their children too. How can a nation progress if its women and children are subjected to discrimination? Therefore, it is vital that we work towards equal compensation for all men and women - for a brighter future.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, equal pay is urgent issue now, and should be taken up without further ado. Equal pay matters because it is a glaring injustice. But, closing the gender pay gap does require a great push. And, the time has come to push ahead, now!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

The pandemic has also widened the gaps between people and has even affected the lives of illiterate young adults. Education has moved into inline education, work culture has taken up the WFH mode. In short, the digital divide between sections of people has come into the forefront.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In a country like India, a large number of the population is illiterate and they do not have any work that can lead to earning their own income. So, Literacy Day is utilized to drive awareness and spur off activities that can give out different types of knowledge to different people, according to their status and work capability. It also imparts information about the importance of education that can enhance their own earnings so that they can sustain themselves, along with needs of their families.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a rule, education is very necessary for all people, so that they can gather all knowledge about different areas of work and business, so that they can decide a field and then carry out all types of work for their own betterment. We can see around us that all kinds of people are busy carrying out different tasks; and if it is accompanied by appropriate knowledge of the work, then they can soon excel in it - to improve their quality of life. Education enhances people’s growth in life and it also imparts the power to achieve every task properly, without problems which may hamper the work. Once people are literate, they are capable of using their knowledge to manage work properly, that can lead to improving the lives they had been leading not only for themselves, but for others and, society at large. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Understanding entrepreneurial learning<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What is entrepreneurial learning? And what does it mean for entrepreneurs? Entrepreneurial learning is&nbsp;acquiring the necessary entrepreneurial knowledge to improve business performance not for the current state of affairs, but for the future too. It is an ongoing process that involves turning experiences into relevant information that can improve the current setup, so that they can manage a small or medium-sized company.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And, since the theme includes – “narrowing the digital divide”, it also puts the spotlight on digital literacy too. And, today, since everything has become digital, this is very relevant.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, entrepreneurship education is very critical for entrepreneurs to acquire resources, enhance innovative ability and innovative personality, and build multi-level learning channels for entrepreneurs by integrating various knowledge and value systems. Entrepreneurship education per se, has been defined as “a collection of formalized teachings that informs, trains, and educates anyone interested in participating in socioeconomic development through a project to promote entrepreneurship awareness, business creation, or small business development”. You will pick up skills that empower you to succeed in business that you have started, and at a macro level, it will also fuel the economy by generating new jobs<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Significantly, your journey to emerge as an entrepreneur starts from the bottom – from real experiences that test your knowledge, skills and motivations. And, pursuing&nbsp;<strong>entrepreneurial&nbsp;literacy<\/strong>&nbsp;is all about the research you do as you prepare and plan to start your business. &nbsp;The more you learn and grow, the better you will perform as a business leader. Real entrepreneurial skills come from your work and industry experience, and your willingness to continue learning.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>So, entrepreneurial literacy<\/strong>&nbsp;is a real necessity if you have plans to&nbsp;manage your own business and become your own boss.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

    "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Do we live in a society that preaches and practices gender equality?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Gender equality is not just about economic empowerment - it is a moral imperative! It is about equity and includes many political, social and cultural dimensions. It is also a key driver of self-reported mental well-being across the world. Numerous countries, including India, have made significant progress towards gender equality through the right education in recent decades and girls have been given the opportunity to soar. However, the glass is still only half full: women continue to earn less than men, are less likely to make it to the top of the career ladder, and are more likely to be hesitant in pursuing entrepreneurship. However, collaborative efforts from academia and industry alike, can help aid in narrowing the gender gap, especially in the field of entrepreneurship. Teachers play a critical role to prevent gender stereotypes and reduce gender bias right in the formative years of individuals. Training the mind in this direction begins in the classroom. <strong>Acknowledging this noble task performed by teachers among many other, today, on the occasion of Teachers’ Day, the team of  <em>Sheatwork<\/em> applauds their selfless endeavours to create an equal and progressive society<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Where will the right education take us?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The right type of education enables girls and boys, women and men to participate in social, economic and political life and is a base for the development of a democratic society. It is a crucial factor to alter attitudes and mindsets into accepting gender equality as a fundamental social value. Today, entrepreneurship education and equitable economic development are synonymous with each other. Despite women’s constantly increasing participation in the labour market over the past half-century, they remain substantially under-represented as entrepreneurs. Greater educational attainment, gender equality and women entrepreneurship have accounted for about half of the economic growth in many developing countries in the past 50 years. Entrepreneurship plays as important a role in developing countries as in developed ones in creating jobs, innovation, and growth. Fostering entrepreneurship is a key policy goal for governments of all countries which share the expectation that high rates of entrepreneurial activity will bring sustained job creation.  – so why should India be left behind? Right education will take us towards a more self-reliant, sustainable and equal future.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What the experts say….<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, argued that the first five years of an individual’s life are the ‘plastic years’ or more simply, the formative years. According to him,  childhood experiences during those years influence a significant percentage of adult characteristics. Hence, the importance of focused and right teaching during the initial years of our lives cannot be under-valued. When teachers or even parents, avoid separating children based on gender and acknowledge them as individuals the idea of ‘gender discrimination will never take root!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Further, using gender-neutral language when referring to children and giving each child, whether boy or girl equal opportunities in the classroom environment or beyond, will help build confidence in them. Girls are consistently underrepresented among top performers in their careers. The reason for this under-representation is not lack of ability, but lack of opportunity. Hence it is important to ‘teach’ the society and ‘coach’ girls to believe in their abilities and take the leap of faith into the entrepreneurial world.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eradicating gender-inequality!<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Gender inequality means not only foregoing the important contributions that women make to the economy but also wasting years of investment in educating girls and young women. Making the most of the talent pool ensures that men and women have an equal chance to contribute both at home and in the workplace, thereby enhancing their well-being and that of society. Teachers play an extremely important role in instilling this belief in equality, thereby helping young girls to aspire for careers that were previously stamped ‘for boys only’, including entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

    "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-f24faf44-dd3d-49fc-8c10-dd3b0ab2522f\">As we celebrate ‘World Entrepreneurs' Day’, it is imperative that we understand how women contribute to modern society.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-fb1a7871-3930-472c-a52c-74debf4b3131\">Sociologists have concluded that ‘family’ is the main pillar block of a community and I personally wish to enhance this description by adding that ‘the woman’ of a family is the pillar of support for the modern-day family – providing social, mental and even financial support in many cases. Women have shouldered family responsibilities like cooking, cleaning, child-rearing and sculpting their personality since time immemorial. Lately, women have also begun to pursue careers, thereby not only instilling the much-needed feeling of ‘self-worth’ in themselves but also providing financial support to their loved ones, financial independence for self and also simultaneously aiding in the economic growth of the nation. For example, according to the Sixth Economic Census, an estimated 13.5 million women-owned enterprises are creating direct employment for 27 million people.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-310b75c8-494f-4bc0-8953-689521712594\">So, with women becoming entrepreneurs it is a win-win situation for everyone, after all women empowerment does affect the socio-economic situation of the country in positive ways. Time management skills and a passion to learn; a zeal to work have always been a woman’s strengths which help her to walk the line, balancing the personal and professional fronts perfectly. &nbsp;It is pertinent to note that an empowered woman will also raise an empowered child; the foundation for a progressive tomorrow.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-d0ec7fb0-e387-4f67-8555-ae3c97ca8782\"><strong>How communities can help women entrepreneurs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-92e65564-306a-4e40-86bb-4a033a973aca\">The success of a woman entrepreneur can be partially attributed to her family as well. As the ‘lady of the house’ steps into the role of an entrepreneur, it is her family which becomes her backup system at home. Whether it be taking care of food, health, banking, children – the family steps in equipped to handle all concerns when needed, in ‘her’ absence due to work-related issues. It is noteworthy how families play such a crucial role in women’s entrepreneurial experiences, not always as a source of restraints, obligations and duties but also as a source of resources and support.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-759158ae-5a9f-48a7-9ced-64352872cc18\">As much I would like to say that if women have potential, they will succeed; this view, however, is too idealistic, too optimistic. Statistically, India, unfortunately, ranks a distant low at 70 among 77 countries in the Female Entrepreneurship Index by GEDI. ‘She’ supports her family all the time, so its time she received some support from her family while she embarks on her entrepreneurial endeavours. This is how it can be done:-<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-a7f5474e-544f-4c20-8e61-c0dca9fce807\">*To begin with, families should encourage women to dream big and bring&nbsp; their ideas to a consequence.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-da7518bc-7a49-4319-8142-f9c6f978c1d0\">*Providing the much needed financial support for investing into her enterprise, can be a major hurdle removed from her path.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-d024a36e-f8da-40e5-9e87-f988dbcd810d\">*Spousal support to erase the fear of imbalance the woman may create within her work and family priorities can work wonders for her confidence level.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-ccbe1012-50e0-4864-b581-245975a555cd\">* Family concerns can nip many entrepreneurial ideas in the bud and to avoid this, a reliable house help can be arranged or duties can be distributed amongst the family members.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-9e039163-b2f5-4a49-a6b9-44108a508b2f\">Families can experience the ultimate sense of belonging through the tender care of the ‘lady of the house’; and businesses, economy and societies benefit largely from these women when they step out in all dynamism and capability. Investing in women is good for all, because when you invest in a woman, the profits are for everyone to share.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p id=\"block-a73ee920-feb9-4c7c-8d06-84b0b8adc64e\">Undoubtedly, the hands that rock the cradle can indeed rule the world – BUT with their family’s support!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

However, with women empowered to create their own businesses, that is rapidly changing. If talking about the women’s status in Independent India, then it has surely improved. The structural and cultural changes in India have brought in many opportunities for women in the fields of education, employment, politics and entrepreneurship. It is observed that women participation in entrepreneurial activities not only aids&nbsp; their family income but also plays a significant role in economic development and social well-being of the society. Naina Lal Kidwai, the first Indian woman entrepreneur, was also a banker, Chartered Accountant, business executive and &nbsp;a former President of the&nbsp;Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI).

She completed her Dental Residency from AIIMS followed by her Masters in Dental Surgery. However, while honing her skills in dentistry, she also realised her inclination towards singing. She is currently running her chain of dental and skin care centres Rejove Clinique in Delhi\/NCR. Dr. Goyat shared with sheatwork, how her unwavering commitment towards helping people made her take up medicine.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Read on as she shares her journey and future endeavours to tide over the pandemic, her advise for women entrepreneurs and much more….<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What are the factors that made you take up medicine as a profession?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>PG: I chose medicine because I always felt compassion towards people and nursed the desire to do my bit in helping them. Dentistry on its own is a complete science. It is a perfect combination of aesthetics &amp; science and can make a huge impact and difference in the way people look, feel and function.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How do you manage to devote time towards singing along with your professional commitments?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>PG: Singing has always been my passion since I was young. I also like challenging situations and managing both singing and medicine often pushes my limits, but it's also very exciting. It’s often said that once you choose a profession that you love, you don't feel that you're working every day. I think it's the same for me. I love singing and I love my medicine aesthetics, where I can beautify people. And singing adds the perfect flavour of happiness in my life that also reflects in my work.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How do manage to find time for ‘Riyaz’ for singing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>PG: I'm an early riser and dawn of the day is the perfect time to reconnect with yourself. And I believe singing and ‘Riyaz’ is a form of meditation that actually made me more focused to deliver better results at work.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The ongoing pandemic has put a tremendous amount of strain on the field of medicine and medical professionals. How challenging was it for you to manage your chain of clinics in this pandemic?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>PG: The pandemic has been a challenge for all the business’ and ours is no different. We opted for a leaner management &amp; cut down on unnecessary overheads just to maintain our never-ending dedication to serve people. We also had to downsize from five clinics to three clinics. We even found out one of my key directors was cheating on us. Our entire business perspective also changed as majority of our clientele came from the international market and with global travel closing down, we had to make the necessary deviations. However, we kept moving with our unwavering commitment of serving people and it has been very rewarding.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What is the single biggest challenge to strike a work-life balance?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>PG: To manage your professionalism, which is your daily bread &amp; butter, as well as being a full-time mother to an infant and being there for the family in the time of need is challenging. One has to be highly attentive and productive to manage all these fields and when we attain that kind of focus, it becomes easy and comes naturally to you, just like your daily chores.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What suggestions would you like to give to aspiring women entrepreneurs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>PG: I would suggest them to set up their own independent practices and believe in themselves, even when no one else would. Strive, pursue and not give up on their goals, no matter how much the world puts them down. Also, never let anyone tell them that they are not good enough because their efforts to establish themselves prove that they are better than scores of people out there.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What are your future plans?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>PG: To remain at the forefront of technology and innovation and provide quality treatment through our unwavering focus is our endeavour. I am looking to expand my chain of clinics and we are already introducing new techniques in the field of dentistry like a 3D scan system and much more. We want Rejove Clinique to be synonymous with quality treatment all across the country by staying true to our ethos &amp; principles, which is non-negotiable for us.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

To work you need to ‘feel’.”<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The pandemic has forced many of us to reckon with different feelings and situations and its having a documented negative impact on people’s mental and physical health; and one powerful tool people are turning to are practices like yoga, mindfulness and other fitness formats, giving rise to many entrepreneurs in this space, observed Ruby Sinha, founder sheatwork, in a conversation with Natalie Pote, fitness entrepreneur, who wears many hats. She is a fitness coach, who is present here for the Athletics &amp; Fitness Association of America, certified trainer from the National&nbsp; Academy of Sports Medicine, USA, certified nutrition coach, a licensed yoga and zumba expert, choreographer, teacher and event planner.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Read on, as she discusses her journey, the team, support system, the challenges faced, the marketing mantras she follows, some fitness tips and more….<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS. Take us through your journey. How did you become a fitness coach?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP:&nbsp; Honestly, it’s something inborn, something I always wanted to do, but didn’t know how. For our generation, while growing up, it wasn’t really a profession or a career option for women or young girls. Now, thankfully, it’s accepted.<br>It was my students and clients who inspired me. I started off as a zumba instructor and I was inspired by my students seeing how much fun they were having and how much they were letting go! I saw how physical fitness made them feel so good and I realised I wanted to take this further. One thing led to another –zumba to group fitness, personal training which led to nutrition, yoga….I keep learning!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: When you started the venture, you were alone. What sort of a team do you have to help you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: While conceptualizing, the creativity – first let me tell you I have a bit of OCD! I want everything my way and I want it done perfectly.&nbsp; The backend work is mostly done by me but sometimes I need help. I have a team of dedicated people like if I am working with schools I have a group of young college students, who have grown with me.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: Basically if you’re running it solo, you created a network, a support system, who is there, if you have a big project coming up.<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: Absolutely.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: What are the important pre-requisites for setting up your own fitness venture?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: Fitness is contrary to what people believe. For a lot of them approach me and one of them said that he had space and no pillar, so a studio can be started! <strong><em>I feel a call to fitness is not a job, it’s a vocation. To work you need to ‘feel’. Your client is not just a client you are responsible for their lives, their well-being and I mean their mental well-being as well.<br><\/em><\/strong>Once I stopped a trainer telling a lady not to try zumba and he said – “Look at you!” I stopped him and chastised him. Then there was a lady in her 60s, who was motivated and I didn’t expect her to do what I do; for people it’s their belief, it’s that one hour when they can be them! Coming back to the trainer, I told the owners that if he did not apologise, I am not working here!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: You’re saying that you should respect your client, build a bond and have a passion. It’s not like any other job – a Mom&amp;Pop store and get someone else to do the job for you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: Absolutely. You cannot tell a client that, for then, you have demotivated her!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: Throughout your journey, especially during the pandemic, have you seen more and more people come for training virtually, or what are the challenges you were facing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: To be honest with you, when it was a complete lockdown, it actually worked in my favour! I had more people online. One reason is that people have started realizing the benefits of working out, of fitness.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: Do you see more of women in this business? How is the gender issue here, according to you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: For zumba, yes there are more women. When it comes to personal training, I see more men. Coming to the earlier stereotype, girls did not do this. It was men for fitness and girls for dance and zumba. Now women are doing it and women clients are more comfortable with women. It’s changed now.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: While training, clients come from metros. Do you have any clients from non-metros?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: Not really!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: How important is marketing for you, especially during the pandemic. Have you been using digital marketing tools amplifying your social media account to promote your business?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: To some extent yes. I don’t have a paid account, it is still a general account but it has translated to work. I have quite a few students, especially from other parts of the world, like right now, after this interview, I have a class for students in Chicago! It’s making world so much smaller. Being online has taken a lot from us, but at the same time, you have to weigh the pros and cons and make it work for you!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: Does most of your business comes from reference (through your website)?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: A lot of it is through referrals of late, and LinkedIn&nbsp; has actually helped and also&nbsp; my social media account on Instagram.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: As a woman entrepreneur, we lead very stressful lives. What are your fitness&nbsp; tips for women entrepreneurs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: My advice would be – just like when you go to work, you have a routine, create one. Have a routine, and stick to it.<br>Also have a ‘Do not disturb’ sign (which I put up on the back of my chair and my kids know ‘Mummy is not available now’)<br>Create boundaries.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: You have yoga, zumba, cardio and a host of other terminologies.

You will have something different to look forward to everyday. So, it really works.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: I was looking at your qualifications and you have a lot of international degrees.

A license is something you get after doing &nbsp;a workshop you pay for; and then you are licensed to teach. A certification is when you actually study, do an exam and them practice. A lot of people are confused and assume if they are licensed to teach one thing, they can teach everything, they can go to Youtube and copy-paste workouts. Unfortunately, they are getting by, because of the rates they charge. But many question crop up. &nbsp;As far as clients go – how consistent are these workouts? How good is it for the body? What is going to happen in the long run?&nbsp; These are questions that trainers cannot answer and clients don’t ask for people mostly have a particular immediate reason – like getting ready for a wedding, so losing weight for a short period.<br>What I feel is that consistency is key and I feel clients deserve it. As for me, I am empowered and I empower them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: As an entrepreneur it’s so difficult to take off time - one or two hours to exercise.

It’s a vicious cycle. What I would say is – just find the time! Like a quick 15 min <em>surya namaskar<\/em> to start your day with. Once you start your day you will be motivated to come back to it!<br>As for me, my yoga mat is on the floor always, and as I get time, I move to a quick exercise and then, it’s back to work.

    "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>On the occasion of Father's Day (20 June, 2021), sheatwork focuses on how fathers have inspired women entrepreneurs to forge ahead<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Are family ties an opportunity for women entrepreneurs? Looking at the important role of the ‘family’ in women’s entrepreneurial experiences we have seen that family ties inevitably have an impact on their performance. Research has also verified the existence of this strong bond. So, obviously the “family dimension” has a huge impact - especially the role played by fathers.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The women entrepreneurs’ segment has been on the rise and in 2020, India ranked 112 in terms of the gender gap in the overall workforce. And, fathers have left a deep influence on some leading entrepreneurs we check with. Whether it was, their strong work ethic, their ‘never-give-up’ attitude or their advice to just believe in yourself, we came across a strong inspirational sway across different business lines.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, <strong><em>on Father’s Day – June 20 this year, we focus on the mantle that rests on fathers.<\/em><\/strong> And, some select women entrepreneurs have answered this question in many varied ways - how has your father been an inspiration on your journey to become an entrepreneur? Read on to check their reactions:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Anuradha Prasad, Chairperson &amp; Managing Director, BAG Films &amp; Media Ltd<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My father always believed in education of women &amp; he felt that it was most important to have good education. Empowering us - was his most important mantra. He believed that given equal opportunity, a woman would make her place. When I decided to become an entrepreneur his only advice was that - even if you fail, don’t regret….atleast you tried…that’s the mantra I follow till now.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Shammi Pant, Co-Founder, MyJen<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My memory of my father is his beautiful smile. Pearl white teeth and kind playful eyes, he was a man seeking experiences in life. He invested in people and never gave up on anyone. As a businessman, he went through a roller coaster ride of success and failure. For him, I was the intelligent one, who could achieve anything! He made me feel invincible perhaps, that is where my strong sense of independence comes from. Fearless of change I embrace and crave new experiences and seek adventure. I never saw my gender as a limitation. It was only after I grew up, I realised how fortunate I was to have a father who saw me for who I am, and ensured my gender never became an excuse to not to do anything. Rather he made me believe it is my strength.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Jahnabi Phookan, Immediate Past President, FICCI FLO &amp; Co-founder of Jungle Travels India and Assam Bengal Navigation Company under JTI Group<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I want to raise a toast to my father today for his guts to turn entrepreneur in his late 40’s. That was the turning point not only in his life but for the Assam Tea industry as well. And it certainly nurtured my spirit growing up in those electric years.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Back then, Assam had 80 percent of tea production but no Tea Auction centre of its own. The Tea Auction centres were then in Calcutta and in London.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And none of the big 4 Tea Broking firms of India would agree to set shop in Assam.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am proud of my father who just quit as Director, in one of these above mentioned 4 British-origin Tea Broking firms, to take up the challenge to start his own tea broking firm in Assam.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was because of men like my father, Jayanta Kumar Borooah ( affectionately called JK) with his Eastern Tea Brokers Pvt Ltd and two other homegrown tea broking firms that the Guwahati Tea Auction was finally born in 1972. GTAC has turned 50 years old now.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Ruby Sinha, Founder, Sheatwork<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My father’s biggest gift to me was his firm belief in my abilities, which in turn, gave me the self confidence to take on challenges as I grew up. He believed in the power of education and encouraged me to have a career. His strong sense of duty towards his extended family and friends, alongwith his ability to nurture human relationships helped me understand the value of cultivating a great team and building strong relationships at work, as an entrepreneur. He would somehow manage to take out time from his busy life to enjoy a good laugh with friends, watch his favourite team play football, celebrate community events or simply enjoy a good home-made meal, which taught me a life-long lesson in work-life balance, which is more of work-life integration now.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Suffice it to say that this is an initiative taken by the World Health Organization (WHO) to raise awareness about the overall health and well-being of people across the world.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And, now we are facing a spike and there is talk about the second wave. \"Considering the sudden spike in the number of Covid cases across the country, it has become vital for various MNCs &amp; conglomerates to efficiently allocate their CSR resources towards the health sector. No matter how developed a country is, there is not a single medical structure across the world that is capable of handling a nation with over one billion residents. Hence, to ensure the safety of the people of our nation, it is vital for companies to come up with CSR interventions that are solely dedicated to the Health Sector. This will not only help people to have better access to medical facilities but will also aid in providing a significant boost to our Health &amp; Welfare sector. It is important for all of us to come up with interventions to ensure the development of India's Health Sector because only a collective endeavour can help us to achieve true economic and social progress”:&nbsp;<strong>Ms Romira Roy, Founder &amp; Chairperson SEED.<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every year, there is a theme attached to the day. The theme for World Health Day 2020 was to support the COVID warriors - nurses and midwives. And incidentally, WHO honoured the health workers who played a key role in the Covid-19 pandemic, as they chose 2020 as the \"Year of the Nurse and Midwife\" - to accentuate their contribution to make the world a healthier place.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Historical significance<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Historically tracking back, it was in 1948 when the First World Health Assembly was held, it was decided to institute a World Health Day - to raise global awareness on specific themes related to health, in order to highlight an area of importance. So, since 1950, the World Health Day has been celebrated on April 7 every year.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On World Health Day this year, the focus is on a campaign to build a fairer, healthier world.&nbsp; As far as women entrepreneurs are concerned, it is very important that they keep fit and healthy. Only when they are in good health, can they run their businesses skillfully. &nbsp;It is seen that when&nbsp;women&nbsp;become&nbsp;<strong>l<\/strong>eaders (as opposed to men), they bring skills, different perspectives, along with cultural differences which ultimately drive effective solutions. &nbsp;With different perspectives and a sense of awareness,&nbsp;women&nbsp;can investigate finer details to decipher what is really going on behind the scene. Plus women also need&nbsp;healthcare more and even access the&nbsp;healthcare system, much more than men; for besides their reproductive and sexual&nbsp;health&nbsp;needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive&nbsp;health&nbsp;issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With so much attention given to health, COVID-19 highlighted the fact that some people are able to live healthier lives and have better access to health services than others - entirely due to the conditions in which they are born, grow, live and work.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Health is of prime importance today<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Healthcare is not easily within reach of all. Across the globe, some people struggle to make ends meet with scanty daily incomes, fewer employment opportunities, poor housing conditions and education, and they experience greater gender inequality too; plus, they even have little or no access to safe environments, clean water and air, food security and health services. This leads to unnecessary suffering, illnesses and premature death too. And what does this do? It certainly, harms our societies and economies.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>This is not only an unequal world, it is also very unfair. <\/strong>That’s why it is time to call on women entrepreneurs and leaders to ensure that people around them and those who are related to their business stay in good health.&nbsp; Moreover, women&nbsp;leaders&nbsp;must be urged to monitor health inequities, and to ensure that all people are&nbsp;able to access quality health services when and where they need them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>WHO, in highlighting health, shows its commitment to ensuring that everyone, everywhere, can realize the right to good health.

In going a step further in becoming ‘Atma Nirbhar’ and adopting digitization, FM Nirmala Sitharaman presented her first paperless, Union Budget, read out from a ‘Made in India’ tablet! She announced a slew of measures on healthcare and infrastructure to give an impetus to the COVID-hit economy. The Budget for the fiscal year 2021-22 is “like never before”, as it is proposed under circumstances like ‘never seen before’ to pull up the economy ‘like never before’! Where Congress leader Rahul Gandhi &nbsp;highlighted sectors that the government “must” focus on in their&nbsp;Budget, including the MSME sector, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the&nbsp;budget&nbsp;would &nbsp;focus on &nbsp;– Health, Human capital, innovation and R&amp;D Physical infrastructure along with featuring <strong>every section<\/strong> of the society.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While the entire nation sat hopefully, glued to their television sets and social media to know about the&nbsp; government’s plan to spend their money for the next year, here are some reactions we got from successful&nbsp; entrepreneurs about the Union Budget 2021:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Jahnabi Phookan, National President, FICCI FLO - &nbsp;<\/strong>“<strong>The Budget proposed by the Finance Minister will help to boost the revival of our nation’s economy following the COVID induced economic fallout.<\/strong> With its targeted proposals for extending benefits to women in form of policies such as Mega Investments Textiles Park, incentivising one-person companies, implementation of the four labour codes, dedicating 3000 crore to NATS, proposal of funds for the welfare of tea workers especially the women &amp; children in Assam &amp; West Bengal,&nbsp; it will provide a strong foundation for the female strata to rise and thereby support in building an Atmanirbhar Bharat”.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby Sinha, Founder, sheatwork<\/strong>&nbsp; - “<strong>The Budget has some welcome initiatives for all sectors. Appreciating that women had a tough time coping with the post pandemic situation and the need for women empowerment , the Budget is aimed at boosting employment opportunities for women.<\/strong>&nbsp; While tabling the Budget, the FM said that minimum wages will apply to all categories of workers. Women will be allowed to work in all categories and also in night shifts with adequate protection which is a positive move. Free cooking gas LPG scheme, Ujjwala scheme extension to one crore more beneficiaries are other positives for women. The Budget overall boosts entrepreneurship, encouraging one-person startups as well. &nbsp;This will help women to start ventures from home and scale up as need be. Steps to boost education and healthcare will ensure easier access to these facilities to large sections of the population, including women.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shammi Pant, Co-founder, MyJen.ai - <\/strong>\"<strong>This budget reinforces the focus on the fundamentals with intent to revive the economy from the unprecedented pandemic setback of last year.&nbsp; <\/strong>In a major way it focuses on Health, Infrastructure and further rationalization of our financial regulations, which is going to give the economy an impetus in revival and put the focus back on fundamentals. The startup community welcomes the attention given in Budget speech of the Finance Ministry and we thank the government for announcements regarding Tax Holidays and Capital Gain Exemptions.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Parbati Bhattacharya, Proprietor, Wanderers Footprints Travel Boutique–<\/strong> “<strong>This Budget has been presented in the shadow of an unprecedented crisis and Government efforts are commendable. Even so, I am disappointed because the Budget has overlooked the Hospitality Industry<\/strong>. The industry really needs some support as it is amongst the worst hit by the pandemic. While the situation is beginning to improve, the hit has been huge and a little support from the government would have been more than welcome. However, as a woman, I like the part which in an attempt to reinvigorate Human Capital, grants women the freedom to work in all categories with adequate protection.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Himani Mishra, CEO &amp; Co-Founder, Brand Radiator - <\/strong>\"<strong>My expectations as a woman entrepreneur are that the Government and its allies, autonomous organisations, must provide relief in EMD, Total Turnover requirement, and experience years, besides other complicated terms and conditions, in its purchases\/procurements, to promote Women Entrepreneurship. <\/strong>As ‘Women Entrepreneurship’ is a new chapter in Indian Business, women have mostly not achieved large number of years in experience and have lesser turnover, as well.I would like to quote Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam, our beloved, former President, who said “Empowering women is a prerequisite for creating a good nation; when women are empowered, society with stability is assured\".&nbsp; Empowerment of women is essential as their value system leads to the development of a good family, society and ultimately a good nation.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Romira Roy, Chairman, SEED<\/strong> - “<strong>The six-pack budget proposed by the Finance Minister encompasses the true spirit of sustainable and equal growth<\/strong>. The push for the health sector and the skilling space with tie-ups with UAE and Japan, to begin with, will go a long way. The focus on revamping the health infrastructure, the push for aggressive disinvestment with LIC’s IPOs, Tax holiday for start-up, expansion &amp; strengthening of nameless faceless IT along with the revision of years are something to be applauded. Although tax slab revisions &amp; further involvement of the private sector in the COVID vaccination distribution is something that could have also been looked at. Over all, it was a well-balanced budget given the fiscal deficit constraints”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Usha Jha, Owner, Petal Crafts<\/strong> – “In all, I feel, the Budget is a well-proposed one. A good portion has been allocated for infrastructure development, healthcare sector and education; and this is a positive step. However, the common man will be affected due to the increase in petrol prices by 2.50 rupees because logistic expenses will increase, thereby making necessary, everyday usage items costlier. Also, the middle class has not been granted any tax-relief and this is a little disheartening. Another cause for concern is that, custom duty on raw silk and cotton have been increased.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;In conclusion, as an Indian citizen, a representative of the common masses, I would like to share my view, that,&nbsp; balancing growth with fiscal prudence is what a budget should &nbsp;aim to do. <strong>I perceive the Union Budget 2021,&nbsp; as a shift in gears to help accelerate the pace of economic growth of our country. Hopefully, if the government ‘walks’ the impressive talks, Budget 2021 will indeed be seen as the ‘Budget of the century’!<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

It should be ensured that women are in positions of power so that they can have direct influence over policy. Incidentally, men outnumber women, as most heads of states are men, and so is the case with 2\/3rds of the world’s lawmakers too.

The idea is to&nbsp; &nbsp;broadcast and celebrate the unique role that tourism plays in our ecosystem. The sector's unique ability to drive economic development and create opportunities beyond metropolitans, especially to those communities which would otherwise be left behind, and its role in preserving and promoting our rich cultural heritage globally, will be particularly celebrated this year. More locally, within our country, we see the future of hospitality and tourism in the post-COVID-19 era, as a promising road ahead both, in the urban and rural sectors- especially for women.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In perceiving Tourism as a window of opportunities for rural areas particularly, Jahnabi Phookan, National President of FICCI Ladies Organization (FLO) very aptly states, \"The beauty of the tourism industry is that it enables you to convert your passion and hobbies into an advantage that can be an applied skill-set in the tourism industry and it helps women to unlock their potential in anything of their choosing.\"<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The tourism Industry had buckled this year due to the fury of the virus, which is yet to be abated. However, with more care and concern for hygiene, a host of tourist destinations are beginning to ease their restrictions; travel enthusiasts are tiptoeing back outside, masks firmly on. So, while the Tourism Industry is slowly limping back to normalcy, it is also creating fertile grounds for women who wish to participate in this sector. Being a human resource-intensive industry, it involves various actors, enterprises and establishments working together in the value chain. This brings in vast opportunities for women to enter the world of hospitality and tourism now. Sanjeeva Shivesh, Founder and CEO of The Entrepreneurship School, in support of this view states, “Travel industry is extremely gender neutral - it is a services business where women can shine - if only we do away with our mental block. With some more government support, the process of including women in the tourism sector can be accelerated.\"<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Indian tourism sector has the potential to drive economic growth, which is the need of the hour. It can add a substantial percentage of growth to India's GDP by the year 2025, simultaneously uplifting the position of women belonging to the financially weaker strata of society, by providing them with sustainable, dignified employment. Therefore, considering the colossal amount of capacity the industry holds for women,&nbsp; Ms. Parbati Bhattacharya, Director of 'Wanderers' Footprints Travel Boutique' advises&nbsp; women entrepreneurs aspiring to take the plunge,&nbsp; \"To weigh the situation and think out-of-the-box in order to sustain themselves in the industry. Gone are the days of package tours and group tours. One must now think of safe and innovative ways of spending a holiday.\"&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

The online discussion with its focus on unlocking\nthe potential of women entrepreneurship in Bihar is the first in a series of\nwebinars aimed at highlighting the state of women entrepreneurship across\nvarious Indian states, organized by Sheatwork.com, a one-stop knowledge hub for\nwomen entrepreneurs. Eminent speakers included : Usha Jha, President- Bihar\nMahila Udyog Sangh and Founder- Petals Craft; Sanjeeva Shivesh, Founder &amp;\nCEO, The Entrepreneurship School; Himani Mishra, Co-Founder &amp; CEO, Brand\nRadiator; &nbsp;Soniya Sanjay Sinha, Vice Chairman, Frontline Business\nSolutions and Vice President- BJP Purvanchal Morcha and Ruby Sinha, Founder,\nsheatwork.com.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The\npanel agreed that many more businesses have embraced digital tools in the wake\nof COVID-19 and women need to understand and accept that such digital\nmarketplaces can support their ventures. According to the panelists, there is need\nfor women to be made aware of product listings, social media presence, GST\nrequirements, aggregators, among other things to be successful businesswomen. The\npanel opined that the overall state of entrepreneurship in Bihar remains\nchallenging and the biggest problem in taking advantage of government policies\nis that women at the ground level are not aware of the policies that exist.\nChanging the mindset to a pro-business mode is the need of the hour and adopting\nlocal resources to go global can be the mantra for success.&nbsp; <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Addressing the webinar, Ms Ruby Sinha, Founder, sheatwork.com<\/em><\/strong>\nsaid, “Most of us are not aware of the various government policies\/incentives\nfor women entrepreneurs implemented by the central and state governments. In fact,\naccording to industry reports, majority of women entrepreneur establishments in\nBihar are self-financed. Only 5% received financial assistance from the\ngovernment, while just 1% have borrowed from formal financial institutions.\nThis inspite of the government announcing a Rs 500 crore Bihar Startup policy\nin 2017 and trying to completely digitise the process through the\nstartup.gov.in website. Through a series of webinars, beginning with this\nedition, we are trying to highlight the state of women entrepreneurship across\nvarious Indian states and bridge the information gap.” <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Ms Usha Jha, President – Bihar Mahila Udyog Sangh, Founder – Petals\nCraft<\/em><\/strong> added, “Due to lack\nof exposure and communication skills, women entrepreneurs of Bihar have been\nunable to present themselves on a national and international stage. There is no\ndearth of skilled women here, but we are yet to tap their skills fully to\nempower them and develop a large section of society socially and economically.\nWomen are half the population but their contribution to business as\nentrepreneurs has not yet received its due credit. I hope platforms like sheatwork’s\n<em>AatmaNirbharShe<\/em> can help address the\ngap in the system.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Ms Soniya Sanjay Sinha, Vice Chairman – Frontline Business\nSolutions, Vice President – BJP Purvanchal Morcha <\/em><\/strong><em>said,<\/em>“Major challenges that women\nentrepreneurs face in the state include family pressures, upbringing, society,\nand gender and socio-economic stereotypes. As soon as people hear that you are\na woman from Bihar, you find two speed breakers in your path. You have to prove\nto naysayers that you are an empowered and a capable woman entrepreneur, even\nthough you may be from Bihar. A strong-headed woman can beat all odds of the\nsociety if given the right amount of push and encouragement.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Mr\nSanjeeva Shivesh, Founder and CEO, The Entrepreneurship School<\/em><\/strong>\nadded, “Bihar is the land where the seeds of Republic was sown. Now it is time\nthat we sow seeds of entrepreneurialism here. It is a big state full of talented\npeople but continues to lag all other states in most economic indicators. The\nonly way this can be altered is by large scale focus on building entrepreneurs\nwho solve local problems. Let Bihar set a vision - to build one lakh new\nenterprises in five years.&nbsp; It is not\neasy. But not difficult either. It has the power to unleash a virtuous cycle of\ninvestments, employment creation and unsurpassed growth anywhere in history.\nLet women become the nebulous of such a vision for all around benefit to every\nsection of the society. A broad-based inclusive ecosystem-based approach by\nengaging youth, business community, educators, investors, lower bureaucratic\nhurdles and right incentives should be the way forward.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Ms\nHimani Mishra, Co-Founder and CEO, Brand Radiator<\/em><\/strong>\nadded, “When a woman determines to start her own venture, the challenges she\nfaces are more on credibility of commitment and societal structure than real\nbusiness problems. It is important for the State Government to formulate a woman-friendly\nbusiness ecosystem. Some of these include relaxation in strict eligibility\ncriteria, turnover capping and mapping the appropriate skill among women\npopulation based on their expertise. To the women folk, I would like to say\nthat more and more businesses are embracing the digital route in the wake of\nCOVID 19. So, one must work towards solutions which are future ready &amp; can\nsync with the changing times. It is not only survival of the fittest, but the\none who adapts to change survives and excels.”\n\nThe forthcoming editions\nof AatmaNirbharShe Entrepreneurship Dialogues across various Indian states will\nbe focused on starting up your business, leveraging various government schemes\nand understanding finer details of entrepreneurship. \n\n\n\n<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Where a CSR agenda is concerned, it proves to create a huge impact and interestingly, important strategic imperatives can also be derived, especially in the light of the challenging times of COVID-19 – as pointed out in the Webinar organized by CII (North Region), that focused on <strong>“<em>Skill Development through CSR”<\/em><\/strong><em>. <\/em> <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The panel discussed ways to provide\nAtmanirbhar, a digitally skilled and inclusive Bharat. Digital platforms across\nverticals like healthcare, education, retail can indeed, generate significant\nemployment in the near future, especially in the financial quarters coming up.\nThe pace at which skill-building is innovating and getting integrated in online\nmodels is manifesting the fact that it is very critical, against the new\nemerging realities. The experts vouched for\nonline learning models to build a sustainable skilling program.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Batting for strong inter-agency partnerships and bridging the digital\ndivide, the panelists agreed that COVID has changed the way resources are\nallocated in CSR. The renewed focus is on employability that leads to\nemployment, which in turn, leads to economic upliftment. &nbsp;India is aiming at becoming a 5\ntrillion-dollar economy and enjoys the unique advantage of a huge, young\ndemographic that stands at a crossover of a digital leap. By 2023, 70 million\nmore people will have entered India's workforce (data from&nbsp;the Periodic\nLabour Force Survey (PLFS) 2017-2018). Unemployment concerns have shot up in\nIndia, recently, due to&nbsp;the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>\n<br>\nConsidering the current unprecedented conditions, <strong><em>Dr. Bhaskar\nChatterjee Former Secretary, Government of India, and Former Director General\n&amp; CEO- IICA, Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;observed, “Covid-19 poses special challenges for\nskill development. Today when the world faces a crisis, the government,\ncorporates and implementing agencies are turning to CSR. Promoting education,\nspecial education, employment-enhancing vocational skills is the need of the\nhour and our law has been successful in addressing that. Difficulty in\nskilling, re-skilling and people employment are some of the key challenges we\nneed to address. Government must now act as a facilitator and encourage\ncorporates to go more into the skill development. We also need to meet the\ndynamic needs of the employers by offering flexibility in the courses being\ndesigned, certifications being offered and the way we train our resources”. &nbsp;He added that “the need of the hour is to tap\ninto technology to leap-frog youth of today into employability”. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong><em>Brigadier P K Goyal (Retd), Conference\nChair and Member, Regional Committee on Skill Development and Livelihood, CII\nNorthern Region<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;noted that,\n“COVID-19 and the global lockdown has impacted the skills ecosystem, resulting\nin imbalance in the skills landscape. There is a dire need to skill, upskill\nand multi-skill a huge workforce so there is suitable employability. An\neffective means to do this is through CSR funds. Govt of India, the corporate\nindustry with their funds and the implementing agencies along with consulting\nagencies are the umbilical link to an effective skilling programme.”<br>\n<br>\nNoting the positive aspect,<strong><em> Lt Gen. Dr S P Kochhar, Director\nGeneral – COAI (Cellular Operators Association of India)&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong>remarked, “A good thing, at present, is that the\ngovernment has accepted that skilling is a challenge and they are trying to\naddress the gap. We have been advising a skilling program which is Cooperative,\nCollaborative, Inclusive and Adaptive. If we use technology, such an initiative\nbecomes easier. Training can be normalised across the country, using\ntechnology. We can combine Make in India, Digital India, and Skill India, as\ncomplementary models and CSR plays a major role in supporting this initiative.\nWe can create co-skilling spaces, with soft and IT skills at the entry-level\nsegment, generic sector skills at the next level of the segment, and the third\nlevel being the vaulted training centres where domain knowledge is imparted by\nindustry experts.”<br>\n<br>\nThe webinar also included eminent speakers\nlike&nbsp;Dr Sudhir Kapur, Chairman, Regional Committee on Skill Development\n&amp; Livelihood, CII Northern Region, Ms Anita Rajan, CEO, Tata Strive, Mr R\nAnand, Principal Consultant &amp; Advisor- HR, HCL Tech Ltd, Mr Chetan Kapoor,\nCOO, Tech Mahindra Foundation, Ms Dhanashree Page Head Operations, Digital\nInclusion, CSR, Capgemini India, Ms Romira Roy, Executive Director &amp;\nFounder SEED, Mr Ashish Singh, Head – ITI Projects, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Ms\nMeenu Bagla, VP and CMO, Cyient Ltd, Mr Rahul Agarwal, AVP-Finance, Goodera, Mr\nMahesh Munjal, Co-Chair Regional Committee on Skill Development and Livelihood,\nCII Northern Region &amp; CMD, Majestic Auto and Mr Arun Nalavadi, ED-\nSustainability and Partnerships, Magic Bus India Foundation.<br>\n<br>\nThe panel outlined ways for India Inc to utilise\nits CSR Funds to undertake skilling programs that are vital to restart the\neconomy.

India will most certainly achieve this”. Moreover, history is evidence\nto the fact that when India is determined to achieve something, it has always\ndone so.

In the present state of crisis caused due to the COVID-19, a huge group of migrant population, including women, has moved back to their homes in rural areas. They are left unemployed and taking up the challenge of creating more employment opportunities for them, FICCI Ladies Organisation signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the social enterprise Women on Wings.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This collaboration came into being for the sole purpose of providing sustainable livelihoods and economic empowerment for women in rural areas. This partnership will aim to identify and support social enterprises working with rural women in the fields of agriculture, food-processing, eco-tourism, textiles, handicrafts, waste management and non-timber forest products thereby creating jobs for women residing in rural area . This in turn will aid in improving the situation of social and economic unrest brought by the COVID-19. Empowering them is key not only to well-being of individuals, families and rural communities but also to overall economic productivity, given the large presence of women in the agriculture workforce!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/2AAEfTe\">https:\/\/bit.ly\/2AAEfTe<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

    "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>MAKERS India May 17, 2020<br>The popular beverage tea attracts a variety of people across generations, with different tastes, backgrounds and is also seen to transcend borders. ‘Bubble tea’, considered to be the “new drink of young Asians” that can be traced back to Taiwanese tea rooms; but with time, this trend has crossed international borders to establish itself in the West, where it enjoys huge popularity too.  <br>Bubble tea startups have emerged in India over the years. However, Bubble tea yet has to make an impact in the domestic market.<br>Firstly, there is Harshita Jain’s company Necessiteas. Having sold over 200 bubble teas in Delhi and Mumbai since she ventured out, but the current COVID-19 crisis has changed her plans to expand this year.<br>Bengaluru-based tea artist Susmita Das Gupta explains the ‘tea’ basics - “Very simply put, tea is brewed, chai is cooked” and added “if you brew ginger in hot water, it is also tea and since it doesn’t have tea leaves it’s called herbal tea”. She conducts many workshops on tea appreciation and brewing, where she bursts many a popular myth.  <br>Her mission is to take this simple beverage to all the connoisseurs. In the future, her bigger goal is to create a tea curriculum and offer a certificate programme in tea, for which she has been working closely with the Tea Board India. This will be targeted at those who really want to pursue this as a career. It was supposed to be launched on March 18, but unfortunately, because of the coronavirus pandemic, the programme had to be postponed. She hopes it is only a temporary delay, and that she can get on to the planned path soon. The programme will be delivered from Tea Board India’s R&amp;D centre in Kurseong, near Darjeeling.<br>Anamika Singh, the woman behind the international tea brand, Anandini Himalaya Tea elaborates that the tea market has grown from a commodity-based model to a more retail-based model, and is now considered to be more experiential.  This shift has resulted in the opening up of the market for young entrepreneurs. Backed by 30+ years of experience in tea production, manufacturing, and exporting — her family business traces back 35 years to the estates of Darjeeling and Terai, and 17 years in Dharmshala in Himachal Pradesh. Indeed, she is one of the rare entrepreneurial prodigies, who followed the footsteps of her father and mentor Abhai Singh, a renowned tea planter.<br>Entering this space right after school, she started working with tea in 1990 in the Darjeeling Tea estates. Now, 30 years later, she steers Anandini Himalaya Tea, a brand that brings together flowers and herbs of the Himalayas along with exotic spices, creating boutique, handcrafted infusions with classic teas from the Manjhee Valley Tea estate.<br>Today, the reality is that the scope of tea has expanded. It has taken huge strides from being a mere beverage. And, to add to that, the growth of the tea market is estimated to be worth more than $81 billion globally by 2026, according to Statista. Definitely a phenomenon, she says with pride – tea is “a reflection of my life”. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>More at: <a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/2znm8A8\">https:\/\/bit.ly\/2znm8A8<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

The news of these women spread, and it set an example. Soon, others stepped forward – offering to procure, produce, distribute, train, and monitor quality. This is exemplary. In these difficult times, when most were desperately trying to make ends meet, these women entrepreneurs, across geographies, offered to help out, and even started outsourcing work and hiring employees.

    "post_content": "Ravi Venkatesan, chairman of Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship (GAME), recently stated that over one fourth of India’s MSMEs may shut down, if the national lockdown continues for long. If it extends to more than four to eight weeks, most of these businesses would be facing a severe cash crunch, which could put a permanent dent in their long term prospects.\n\nReferencing data presented by the All Indian Manufacturers' Association, Venkatesan said that “19% to 43% of the MSMEs may disappear if the crisis persists 4 or 8 weeks\".\n\nThe primary challenge due to the fall in business would be shortage of funds, while logistical restrictions would lead to loss of large quantities of perishable goods. In addition to this, MSMEs would also have to combat the operational challenges that accompany reduced manpower, since most migrant workers and labourers are returning to their hometown, plagued by hopelessness.\n\nThe former co-chairman of Infosys and chairman of Bank of Baroda, said that GAME is currently working on setting up a $100-million Small Business Stabilisation Fund, aimed at helping these small businesses weather the economic damage of this crisis.\n\nScheduled to be established in a couple of weeks, the fund will be used to offer low-interest loans to such businesses, along with a moratorium of up to three months for repayment. Responsible for creating over 90% of the jobs in India, the MSME sector in the country could see a vast number of these jobs disappear, if the situation continues the same way. The association for entrepreneurs reiterated this, stating that each sector would see loss of jobs, because of the lockdown.\n\nAccording to Mr Venkatesan, the hospitality industry, responsible for employing as many as 4 crore people, can see a loss of roughly 1.2 crore jobs by the end of the crisis. On the other hand, the retail industry, employing 4.6 crore people, could see up to 1.1 crore jobs disappearing due to the crisis.\n\nAs such, GAME stated that it would soon hold discussions with the government to create effective measures that can prevent the \"mass extinction\" of these MSMEs, due to the economic slowdown.",

Under the HerVikas initiative, as it is called, Kinara Capital would disburse Rs. 100 crores of small business loans to women entrepreneurs in India.\n\nThe programme further aims to boost women entrepreneurship through a flat discount on business loans without any property collateral necessary. This is particularly important because ventures by women entrepreneurs constitute 8 million of the 58 million businesses in India, despite which, access to capital is still a major challenge for most of them.\n\nHardika Shah, Founder &amp; CEO, Kinara Capital, said, “Less than 14% of all businesses in India are owned by women, and the number of women entrepreneurs has been declining over the last decade. Empowering women entrepreneurs uplifts local economies and creates new jobs in communities. That’s why we are committing Rs. 100 crores to boost women entrepreneurs’ progress, her vikas!”\n\nAs part of the initiative, women entrepreneurs applying for a loan of Rs. 2 - 25 lakhs from the organisation will also enjoy the benefit of an upfront 1% processing fee deduction. This will be valid for all of its existing loan products, including Working Capital, Bill Discounting, Asset Purchase, Supply Chain Financing, and Line of Credit.\n\nThe scheme is currently live in states like Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and UT Puducherry, where Kinara Capital has as many as 110 branches.",

Mr Gadkari made the announcement at the Bunts Star Achievers Awards 2020, organised for the first time, by the Indian Bunts Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry (IBCCI).\n\nSpeaking about the urgent need for a dedicated institute for enterprises and entrepreneurship in the country, he said, \"MSMEs account for 48 per cent of the exports and employ 11 crore people. We are giving a major boost to the MSME sector...it drives the economy. We need fast decision-making and that is the hallmark of this government.\"\n\nHe further claimed that India continues to be the fastest-growing economy, despite the economic recession affecting the entire world. He added that holistic thinking is imperative to prevent delays in the infrastructural development of the country, saying, \"What matters is the conversion of knowledge to wealth and waste to wealth. Environment and development must go together.”\n\nUnion chemicals and fertilizer minister Sadananda Gowda also echoed his words, stating that during the tenure of the BJP-led NDA government, the ease of doing business in India has improved massively, earning it a World Bank global ranking of 63, compared to the earlier 134.\n\nHe attributed a massive part of this improvement to the GST policy introduced by the NDA government, saying \"GST Council is an autonomous body and in the last two-and-a-half years there has not been a single incident of dissent. By 2025, Rs 100 crore worth infrastructure projects are coming up.”",

The event was aimed at motivating women in the state of Meghalaya to take up entrepreneurship, and achieve financial independence.\n\nTathagata Roy, the governor of Meghalaya, was the chief guest for the inaugural programme, while health and family welfare minister AL Hek was the guest of honour.\n\nThe governor said that women have always held a special position in the Northeastern region, and with Meghalaya being a matrilineal society, women entrepreneurs must further leverage the opportunities it offers.\n\nHe said, “This seminar is important in the sense that we are trying to make our entrepreneurs be job givers rather than job seekers. Meghalaya has abundance of resources that can be made into a product, and agro-based products if systematically cultivated and packed and if MSME can act as a facilitator, it can create a whole new platform for the entrepreneurs.”\n\nThe minister also delivered a speech encouraging entrepreneurs to develop patience and work hard, to find success. He said that the market conditions should also be evaluated carefully, and their products should be conceptualised on the basis of their findings.\n\nOther notable attendees of the event included DS Rawat, chairman of the MSME Export Promotion Council, Theilin Phanbuh, chairperson of the Meghalaya state Commission for Women, and B Mawlong, the Joint Secretary to the Government of Meghalaya, Commerce &amp; Industries Department.",

The collaboration will also allow it to work with stakeholders like incubators, government bodies, and investors, while taking advantage of the specializations of partner institutions, to spread awareness and enhance knowledge.\n\niVEIN was launched at the ‘Dialogue with Stakeholders’ event, organised by IIT Bombay’s Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SINE).\n\nThe initiative is being coordinated by Prof. A Thillai Rajan, from the Department of Management Studies at IIT Madras. He highlighted the growing focus on innovation, venturing, and entrepreneurship from policymakers, and their critical role in India’s economic growth, along with its position as an innovation country.\n\nHe added that iVEIN will enable and support academic bodies in conducting extensive research, and enhancing knowledge through conferences and journal publications.\n\nProf. B Ravi, the head of the Desai Sethi School of Entrepreneurship at IIT Bombay, said, “The proposed network would create a strategic bridge between various stakeholders, strengthen the ecosystem and synthesize the knowledge that exists in silos among different groups.”\n\nFurthermore, it will also establish an interdisciplinary body of knowledge which presents multiple perspectives, keeping in mind the requirements of policymakers, innovators, entrepreneurs, investors academic researchers, and students, along with anyone else interested in innovation and ventures. This will also enable effective policy formulation and help nurture thought leadership in individuals.\n\nAs such, the consortium invited all institutes, organisations, and individuals, particularly policymakers, investment managers, practitioners, and entrepreneurs, to collaborate with each other, and drive the entrepreneurship mindset further.",

    "post_content": "A new report by Bain &amp; Company and Google, published on February 18<sup>th<\/sup>, states that women entrepreneurship can create an extremely transformational impact on employment in India. According to it, women entrepreneurship can create as many as 150-170 million jobs in the country, exceeding the number of new jobs required for its total working population by 2030, by over 25%.\n\nTitled “Women Entrepreneurship in India – Powering the economy with her\", the report highlights the urgent need for focused efforts on enhancing women entrepreneurship in India, both in quantity as well as quality, in order to combat the many existing employment challenges in the country.\n\nThe report has identified six unique segments of women entrepreneurs in the country, and estimates a total of 13.5–15.7 million women-owned enterprises in existence. This makes up roughly 20% of all enterprises in India, today. However, women are also often named as proprietors and owners, for tax, financial, and administrative purposes, with little to no actual role in the organisation.\n\nIt found that the majority of women-owned enterprises are single person ventures, with the largest segment, accounting for 38% of all ventures, made up of rural non-farm home-based business owners. The second biggest segment, at 31%, is made up of urban self-employed women entrepreneurs, who mostly work from home.\n\nThe third segment, at 18%, represents rural farm-based entrepreneurs, while the fourth is small business owners, at 14%, made up of urban entrepreneurs (6%) and rural entrepreneurs (8%), who have less than 10 employees, despite having the largest contribution towards employment generation.\n\nThe last segment is named the scalers, who are entrepreneurs employing over 10 people, making up less than 1% of the survey. However, when put together, all of these women entrepreneurs directly employ roughly 22 to 27 million people, today.\n\nAs such, the report also draws attention to the vast opportunities available to boost both the quantity and quality of entrepreneurship, thereby creating more than 30 million women-owned enterprises, 12 million of whom can generate massive employment opportunities for the country.\n\nMegha Chawla, partner at Bain &amp; Company and the lead author of the report, said, “In spite of India’s economic progress in the last decade, women’s participation in the labour force has declined and is expected to be under pressure due to labour trends, technological disruption and constraining social barriers. Unlocking entrepreneurship amongst women in India is a complex effort, but it provides an unprecedented opportunity to change the economic and social trajectory of India and its women for generations to come. This will drive tremendous job creation and also deliver transformational social and personal outcomes for women.\"\n\nSapna Chadha, senior country marketing director for Google India and Southeast Asia, Google, said, “At Google we have been investing in scaled skilling efforts across SMBs, Startups and overcoming the digital gender gap in the country through the Internet Saathi program.\"\n\nThe report also laid emphasis on four critical opportunity areas for enhancing women entrepreneurship in India, including creating a level playing field for impactful, employment-generating entrepreneurs, encouraging more women to take up entrepreneurship, and developing, strengthening, and scaling up productive rural agripreneurs.\n\nRajan, Partner at Bain &amp; Company, as well as a co-author of the report, said, “Implementing these interventions to accelerate prospective and current women entrepreneurs will need a deep recognition of the urgency, and a multi-year coordinated scaled effort between various ecosystem participants. These include national and state governments, grass-root organisations, investment and banking communities, other private enterprises, educational institutions and the media. This report is a start and is the compass needed to consolidate and coordinate efforts across high impact areas.\"",

Known as IMAGE, it is also the first incubation centre in India for businesses which deals with IP in gaming, VFX, AI, and computer vision set up by Software Technology Park of India (STPI).\n\nSTPI-IMAGE entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with five partners at the launch, Telangana VFX, Animation and Gaming Association(TVAGA), Hyderabad Angels, Hyderabad Software Exporters Association (HYSEA), and IIIT-Hyderabad. This is aimed at helping it encourage and support startups and promising entrepreneurs with mentoring and technology support, along with the required infrastructure and funding.\n\nThe facility spreads over 10,000 square feet, and is situated inside the existing STPI facility. It aims to incubate as many as 25-30 start-ups, every year, for the next five years. To this end, Rs 19.68 crore would be invested for the CoE as well as on existing infrastructure, over 5 years.\n\nOmkar Rai, director general of STPI, said, \"The CoE will bring a paradigm shift in revving up research and innovation in gaming, VFX, computer vision and AI through a robust ecosystem in collaboration with tech partners, industry, investors, industry associations and government, and will bolster indigenous product development while propelling the growth of tech entrepreneurship in the country. By collaborating with industry associations, academia and angels, we have ensured the IMAGE incubation model is built on a solid foundation to realising our mission to build world-class gaming, animation, and deep tech providers to the world.\"\n\nThe selected startups will receive funding support via a seed fund of Rs 5 lakh, with 20 start-ups being onboarded in the programme in the first year. Each of them would be able to make use of state-of-the-art infrastructure and R&amp;D lab facilities. This would help in the development and validation of design and prototyping solutions, in order to democratise innovation, along with the newly established and first of its kind motion capture lab in the facility.",

However, over the years, countless women have broken through these barriers and conquered new heights, inspiring many others to do the same.\n\nThus, Safejob, powered by Safeducate, in association with the Women Entrepreneurship Platform – a NITI Aayog initiative, has launched the ‘Dhasu Woman’ campaign, to celebrate the incredible journeys, achievements, and contributions, of such women.\n\nThe campaign revolves around an upcoming music video for the ‘Dhasu Woman’ theme song, encouraging women from all ages and walks of life, from all over the country, to be a part of it.\n\n30 of the most unique stories would be handpicked from the submissions, by recognising and evaluating women who have created new milestones and landmarks in a variety of industries. This will include many inspiring women who are tirelessly working to make the world a better place, from entrepreneurs and scientists, to educators, lawyers, activists, and more.\n\nThe last date for submissions is 20th February 2020, and after the final shortlist, the Dhasu Woman music video will be released, on 8th March 2020.\n\nDivya Jain, Founder and CEO of Safeducate, said, “We are delighted to partner with NITI Aayog’s Women Entrepreneurship Platform as we work towards our shared objective of identifying and celebrating the various dhasu women who have made an extraordinary impact in their chosen domains. We are committed to conducting the process of distilling the entries down to the 30 most unique stories as diligently as befits this amazing opportunity to commend the incredible work being done by the marvelous women – mothers, thought leaders, industry experts, pioneers, homemakers – around us. The cherry-picked stories will then be woven into the music video that will be released on Women’s Day.”\n\nShe further added, “International Women’s Day is a time for us to celebrate the fabulous women of the world and everything that we have stood and fought for to bring about massive changes in the societies that we live in. While there is still a long way to go, there is also enough to take pride in. There is little that can match the strength and enduring spirits that women have kept alive over time, and this is the overarching theme of our Dhasu Woman campaign as well. Together, we have reached where we are today, and the song serves as a reminder to keep our unwavering determination going. We look forward to the entries and are convinced that they are going to make this music video truly special.”",

    "post_content": "The 11<sup>th<\/sup> edition of TiEcon Mumbai was held with much fanfare on 28th – 29th January 2020 at NCPA, Nariman Point, Mumbai. The event was aimed at highlighting the importance of Startups in socio-economic development, transformational growth, and job creation, for a country.\n\nThe rapid evolution of the Indian startup ecosystem can help create several useful solutions, leveraging innovation and scalable technology.\n\nAtul Nishar, President TiE Mumbai, said, “TiEcon Mumbai 2020 provided a comprehensive understanding of growth drivers and motivation for Indian Startup founders, identified challenge areas, and outlined pillars in place that support them.”\n\nAshish Hemrajani, Founder of BookMyShow.com and Harsh Jain, Founder of Dream 11, were the ‘Startup Show Stoppers’ for the event. They shared several practical insights while emphasising that successful startups are not just about an idea, but also about execution. For this, culture, humanity and integrity, must be etched into the foundations of all companies.\n\nWhile Mr. Nishith Desai delved into the legal framework of startups, discussing various intriguing topics like limited liability for Robots, Farzana Haque, Business Director of TCS, said, “This is the decade where India is headed to be a developed Country. Build the future on sustainable model with a global mindset.”\n\nThe theme this year was ‘The Decade of Start Ups – Kick starting the Future’, with a focus on technology-led innovation and disruption which will transform businesses. As such, it also explored the future of ideas, entrepreneurship challenges, governance and law, and the leadership and support required for a startup to flourish. The event highlighted the best practices that can help the ecosystem grow, as well as promote stakeholders through engagement.\n\nThe event also consisted of a unique debate between six renowned angel and early stage investors, “Are there enough Angel investors in India?”. The debate aimed at shedding light on the need for more investors to take a chance on promising entrepreneurs to help their ventures flourish.\n\nThe evening ended with a fireside chat between Sheela Birnstiel and actor and entrepreneur Neha Dhupia. Mrs Birnstiel spoke about the many lessons that entrepreneurs could take from her life, encouraging them to live independently and create ventures that they love working on.",

Several themes will be explored, including the future of entrepreneurship in the new decade, as well as trust and ethics in data in today’s age. The event will have more than 150 speakers, as well as 600 CXOs and 1,500 delegates, in attendance.\n\nSangeeta Gupta, Senior VP and Chief Strategy Officer of Nasscom, said, \"It’s 2020, the start of a new decade. Over the last 4-5 years, the focus has largely been on digital and how digital is re-shaping the industry. The theme about digital being important is now well accepted. For NTLF 2020, the focus was on how do we look ahead.\"\n\nShe also stated that NTLF will particularly focus on the theme ''Tech In 20''s: Coming of Age'', and elaborate how the next decade is projected to help catalyse businesses and accelerate innovation, at the core level.\n\nShe said, \"This is going to be the age of entrepreneurship. We have done well in our journey but what does the future of entrepreneurship look like as we look ahead in the decade?\"\n\nShe further added that discussions would also take place on topics like developing trust through data and privacy, trade wars, regulations, inclusivity, and sustainability. As such, there is an urgent need to understand that technologies will keep changing, and organisations must constantly update themselves to keep pace with them.\n\n\"Today it''s artificial intelligence and blockchain, tomorrow it maybe quantum. Technologies will continue to shift and evolve but how do business build their organisations to be able to deal with this continuous technology change. It is also important that we build learning organisations to ensure skilling and re-skilling,\" she said.\n\nA number of celebrated figures from the Indian and global technology industry will attend the three-day event, including the likes of Wipro Chairman Rishad Premji, Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran, TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan, and Infosys CEO Salil Parekh.

To this end, it will also focus on the symbiosis between start-ups and large enterprises, as well as disruptive investments and the ease of doing business.",

    "post_content": "Indian finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget 2020-21 in the Lok Sabha today, announcing a slew of measures to combat the ongoing slowdown in the economy.\n\nAspiration, Development and Compassion were the three key themes for this year's budget. In her 2 hours and 40 minutes long speech, the hon’ble minister emphasised that entrepreneurship has always been the spirit and strength of India. Hence, the government recognises the need to support and energise the Indian entrepreneurial spirit, she added.\n\n<strong>Boosting the start-up industry<\/strong>\n\nShe proposed the establishment of an investment clearance cell in order to assist start-ups owners and entrepreneurs in accessing funding. In addition to this, a new portal would also be set up for end-to-end entrepreneurial facilitation. This would greatly enhance the ease of doing business in India, and is expected to provide a major boost to the competitive but flourishing industry. As such, it reflects a focus on talent, technology, and entrepreneurship.\n\n<strong>Focus on women-centric developments<\/strong>\n\nThe Government has also proposed an allocation for women-centric developments, to enhance the lives of women in India. To this end, Rs 28,600 crore will be allocated in FY 2020-21, towards programmes designed to support women.\n\nThe minister also drew attention to the fact that India is now the world's 5th-largest economy, and added that the Central government debt has decreased to 48.7 percent of GDP from 52.2 percent in March 2014. She highlighted that the growth of 7.4 per cent was surpassed in 2014-19 with an average inflation of 4.5 per cent.\n\n<strong>National Logistics Policy for MSMEs<\/strong>\n\nThe budget stated that the government would set up a National Logistics Policy, along with a single window e-logistics market, in order to make MSMEs more competitive, and promote employment generation. The government would also allocate Rs 27,300 crore for the development and promotion of industry and commerce in 2020-21.\n\n<strong>Focus on technology<\/strong>\n\nThe minister said that the government aims to turn every district into an export house. Emphasizing the role of technology in industrial growth, she also announced an allocation of Rs 8,000 crore, over five years, for quantum technologies and applications.\n\n<strong>Women empowerment<\/strong>\n\nFor women in India, one of her key announcements was that the government would set up a task force which will relook and recommend marriageable and child bearing ages for women. She also declared that the “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” scheme has had a tremendous impact, to which, the opposition MPs raised a protest, interrupting her speech; however, she proceeded to cite its many achievements, till date.\n\nShe stated that the gross enrollment ratio of girls in schools and educational institutes in India is higher than boys today. While enrollment for girls at the elementary level is currently at 94.32 percent, it is at 89.28 percent for boys, according to the data presented by her. She added that similar trends hold true for the secondary and higher secondary levels, as well.\n\nThe minister also stated that as more than six lakh Anganwadi workers have been equipped with smartphones, using which, they would now be able to upload nutritional status of more than 10 crore households. Furthermore, the government announced an allocation of ₹35,600 crore for nutrition-related programmes for FY 2020-21.\n\n<strong>New bridge course announced<\/strong>\n\nShe also stated that the government recognizes the incredible demand for medical teachers, caregivers, nurses, and paramedical staff, in foreign markets. As such, a new bridge course would be started in order to offer training and guidance to young people in these fields. She also instructed the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Skill Development to work together, with professional bodies, to create the course.\n\n<strong>Income-centric budget<\/strong>\n\nThe culmination of the above allocations and announcements, along with the reduced income tax slabs and simplified income tax procedure, shows that Budget 2020-21 was designed to boost the income of people. This would not only enhance purchasing power but also the standard of living, all over the country. Finally, the multiple women-centric proposals in the budget, along with entrepreneurial announcements, also lay out a highly favourable year ahead for women entrepreneurs as well, especially start-up founders.",

    "post_content": "The Indian Government has announced an additional loan guarantee of Rs 100 crore for Kerala’s state women’s development corporation. Health minister K K Shailaja revealed the new provision, stating that it was part of the Government’s efforts towards offering more loans to women to promote entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nThe guarantee, backed by the Government, will allow these individuals to obtain greater amounts of loans from the National Backward Classes Finance and Development Corporation (NBCFDC). Earlier, the organisation only offered a guarantee of Rs 140 crore while applying for loans from national financial corporations.\n\nHowever, the Government has now enhanced the guarantee with an additional Rs 350.56 crore. According to the minister, the organisation has also started providing loans to women from scheduled tribes, in order to encourage self-employment.\n\nAs a result, the corporation will now be able to obtain higher amounts of loans, which can be passed off to potential women entrepreneurs at reduced interest rates. The state women’s development corporation is utilised by several agencies of the Central and state governments to facilitate financial empowerment of women in the state.\n\nWhile the organisation has been providing loans at affordable interest rates for the last 30 years, during the tenure of the current government, it has also been able to offer a wide variety of services to as many as six lakh women, through many different schemes.",

The 36-hour hackathon was conducted at the Kotla Vijay Bhaskar Reddy indoor stadium, Yousufguda, from 18<sup>th<\/sup> to 19<sup>th<\/sup> January.\n\nThe 99 participating teams were made up of four members each, from all over the state, and the country. These included students from engineering colleges in Hyderabad, along with startups, corporates, and other young innovators.\n\nThe goal of the hackathon was to create possible solutions to problems in fields like cybercrime, crimes against women and children, road-safety awareness, and combating fake news on social media. Contestants developed several applications and solutions, utilising latest technology like Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics. In addition to this, each participant was also allowed to pitch their ideas to a jury of the Hyderabad City Police and the WE HUB team, along with academia and business mentors from VC firms, corporates, and innovation ecosystem enablers.\n\nThe overall champion of the hackathon was ProjectD, a prototype for reducing sound pollution, was awarded Rs 1,00,000, as a reward. Four other teams were also awarded Rs 20,000 each, and with the help of WE HUB, they will now work on developing their ideas further. Furthermore, a team of four students from MJCET is also leveraging the power of machine language to reduce vehicular pollution.\n\nThe three runners-up were Life of a Girl, a mobile app created by Hyderabad IIIT Students that helps prevent crimes towards women and children, Cyber Knights, a plugin developed by students from CVR College that curbs cybercrime, and Bietians, a hardware device designed by students that helps predict and prevent traffic accidents by cross-referencing accident-prone routes and offering quicker access for ambulances.\n\nDeepthi Ravula, CEO of WE HUB, spoke about the association, saying, “WE HUB collaborated with the Hyderabad police to organise the hackathon so that students, startups and corporates can understand and conceptualise ideas to solve the problems identified. The winning teams and the top 30 teams selected as a part of the hackathon will be further mentored to accelerate from idea to product stage by the Hyderabad Police, WE HUB, along with knowledge partners from corporates, academia and business.”\n\nShikha Goel, IPS, added, “The objective of the event was to elicit coding solutions from the participants for problem statements like cyber-crimes, crimes against women and children, road safety and awareness and social media monitoring. The hackathon was open for college students, start-ups, the IT industry, researchers and officials from the police, defence and other government sectors. The winning coding solutions will be the prototypes on which we will design the products to improve police functions and solve policing challenges.”",

    "post_content": "The World Bank study of women, business, and law (WBL) 2020 showed that India’s ranking had improved by 4%, with a score of 74.4 out of 100, on the WBL Index.\n\nThe study evaluates existing laws and regulations that determine women’s economic opportunity in 190 economies, across eight primary aspects like mobility, workplace, pay, marriage, parenthood, entrepreneurship, assets, and pension. However, it is important to note that the WBL only evaluates the formal laws and regulations determining women’s ability to work or own businesses in the country. It does not take into account the unofficial norms and practices actually in effect.\n\nThis year, India had the highest WBL score in the South Asian region, overtaking Maldives, which was previously in the lead. The study also drew focus on the many steps taken by Maharashtra to remove restrictions on women from working in jobs that are deemed dangerous.\n\nWhile the study shows that India’s score is aligned with the global average, it also highlighted that women largely receive only three-fourths of the legal rights as men do, globally.\n\nIndia occupies the second last position among the BRICS countries, with South Africa topping the list, having a score of 88.1. Next is Brazil, with 81.9 points, followed by China, which scored 1.2 points more than India on the index, but had a marginal drop in its absolute score, during the previous year.\n\nThe study highlighted that reforms aimed at enabling equal opportunity for women actually end up contributing to stronger economies, increased female labour force participation, and improved development, as well. During the last two years, women’s economic empowerment has been made a priority in as many as 40 economies from all regions and income groups, through 62 reforms that facilitate and promote women’s entry into the workforce.\n\nEconomies that saw the most improvement include Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Nepal, South Sudan, São Tomé and Príncipe, Bahrain, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Jordan, and Tunisia. However, eight of the 190 economies surveyed, namely Belgium, Denmark, France, Iceland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Sweden, and Canada, scored a perfect 100 on the WBL Index.\n\nWhile India scored a complete 100 in factors like mobility, workplace, and marriage, it fared much worse in pay (25), parenthood (40), entrepreneurship (75), pension (75), and assets (80). China had several similarities on this regard, scoring quite poorly on pay (25), pension (25), entrepreneurship (75), and parenthood (80).",

    "post_content": "<p>According to the latest survey by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on the Indian startup sector, only 5.9% of startups had “only-female” founders, while as much as 55.5% of startups had “only male” founders. The study was conducted between November 2018 and April 2019, based on 1,246 responses received from startups.<\/p>\n<p>India fared quite poorly on the recently released Mastercard Index of Women Entrepreneurs (MIWE) 2019, as well. The country ranked 52nd out of 58 countries on the list, further highlighting that out of 100 Indian business owners, only seven are women, even now.<\/p>\n<p>While significant improvements have been made to promote female entrepreneurship in India, a number of factors including cultural and social biases have proven to be major challenges. There is still widespread resistance that working women face, whether in starting their own business or working in tech fields, which makes the disparity even more pronounced.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, they also receive greatly limited access to financial privileges, and severe challenges in seeking funding. The survey showed that friends and family constituted the biggest source of funding for these startups, making up 42.9%, as opposed to angel investors, incubator funding, and venture capital firms, to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>Yet another study by the MIWE says that only 5.7% of Indian women entrepreneurs consider borrowing money for business purposes, which highlights the obstacles even more clearly. It says, “Apart from the lack of government programs to support business startups, [Indian] women tend to have poor financial backing that prevents them from owning credit cards or having a bank account – conditions [restrict] them from engaging in large scale businesses or entrepreneurial activities that require large funding.”<\/p>\n<p>As a result, women entrepreneurs in India have to deal with several prominent handicaps in order to achieve business success - financial disadvantage; infrastructural shortcomings; lack of effective government support programs; fewer opportunities for higher-level education; and cultural bias regarding their efficiency in STEM fields, owning businesses, and more.<\/p>\n<p>To this end, the administrative and cultural changes necessary for the development of conditions that support women entrepreneurs, must come from the government in partnership with the overall startup industry. Not only will this help provide a boost to women owned enterprises, it will, in turn, also contribute to the national economy at a grassroots level, to create a more harmonious, diversified future.<\/p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

The funding agreement was facilitated by the Australia-ASEAN Council of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\n\nThe project is being carried out by a hand-picked team, including Dr Felix Tan of UNSW Business School, with the funding being used to conduct a number of workshops in Canberra, Jakarta, and Bangkok. The workshops aim to shine a light on the role of women in technology-driven entrepreneurship, and the immense potential they possess for communities. They will particularly focus on university students and leaders of youth groups, and also create a series of frameworks and roadmaps, to enhance awareness in the country.\n\nDr Tan said, “The entrepreneurial potential in rural areas of ASEAN countries like Indonesia is fast growing Many small business ventures with the right training and support are using mobile phones to take their small stores online. In some areas, local governments note women account for up to 80% of new entrepreneurs.\n\nWe want to help them – particularly the young women – build their digital entrepreneurship skills. It’s not just about the economics, there are enormous social benefits too.”\n\nSeveral case studies of currently existing digital programs in farming communities across ASEAN countries will be shared at the workshops. They will also discuss the impact of digital marketplaces, and the current state of women’s digital entrepreneurship initiatives and small to mid-size enterprises. These include ventures in West Java and South Sulawesi of Indonesia.\n\nThe project is named Fostering Women's Economic Empowerment through Digital Entrepreneurship, and will receive more than $30,000 from the federal government in funding support, along with $50,000 from Universities and partners.\n\nFor the project, the UNSW Business School and its Institute for Global Development has partnered with Dr Amelia Faisal from Social Trust Fund and UIN Jakarta and Dr Peter Ratcham from Thammsat Business School in Bangkok. Through the Institute, the UNSW community works towards achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals, to create a transformational impact on lives and society.",

A breast screening initiative was also launched alongside the two schemes, at the Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Stadium in Taleigao town, near the Panaji district of Goa.\n\nThe Yashaswini Scheme is aimed at supporting and promoting women Self Help Groups (SHGs), by providing interest-free loans of up to Rs 5 lakh, along with guidance from leading experts, in order to enable the socio-economic empowerment of women in Goa.\n\nThe loan will have a tenure of 5 years, with the total loan amount to be paid off in four instalments, starting from the second year. A number of SHGs received loans under the scheme, including Umang Self-Help Group, Adarsha Satari Mahila Mandal Guleli – Sattari, Salcete and Phoenix Women’s Wing Self-Help Group Valpoi – Sattari.\n\nOn the other hand, the Swasthya Sakhi Project is aimed at enhancing women’s wellness and welfare, especially during pregnancy, with a view to encouraging a healthy lifestyle for both the mother and the child.\n\nA diagnostic kit will be provided by the state government to healthcare workers, to help them provide basic diagnostic services to the residents of the state, right at their doorsteps. This will also allow them to digitise all the health information of the patients. The kit will consist of a full set of basic equipment necessary for conducting tests like blood sugar, blood pressure, blood haemoglobin, and heart rate. It has been developed using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds, by the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI). In addition, the kit will also allow the workers to monitor women’s health during pregnancy. This will help make early detection of deficiencies possible, along with the identification of high-risk pregnancy cases, so that timely referrals and treatments can be availed.\n\nAnd finally, the healthcare workers will also screen close to 20,000 women in the state for breast cancer, helping such services to be made available even in the rural areas of the state.",

    "post_content": "On Thursday, January 9<sup>th<\/sup>, Kochi hosted ASCEND 2020, a global investment summit organised by the Kerala government. A number of new important new measures were announced by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at the summit, to promote investment in the state. These included a wage subsidy scheme for new ventures, increasing the financial aid bracket from Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC), relaxation of land ceilings for big firms, assignment of job generation responsibilities for local bodies, and more.\n\nThe Chief Minister emphasised the need to leverage the massive investment opportunities presented by the favourable conditions in the state, especially in light of the massive economic slowdown plaguing the entire country. He also discussed the various measures taken by the state government to promote global investments and ease the procedure of setting up a business in the state for entrepreneurs. He further stated that he aims to end unemployment in Kerala within the next 10 years and help it become one of the five most investor-friendly states in the country.\n\nTo this end, his government is planning to propose the subsidisation of a part of the wage commitment for newly launched industries for the first five years.\n\nHe said, “This is a scheme under consideration. I don’t want to go into its details. This benefit will be available only to those units which provide ESI and PF benefits to workers. I also want to say at this stage that women employees will get at least Rs 2,000 more than their men counterparts under the proposed scheme. An estimated 37 lakh people will benefit.”\n\nYet another important measure is the concession on land ceilings for large firms which invest more than Rs 250 crore, and provide employment to 1,000 people. The Chief Minister said that relevant amendments would also be made in the land legislation act to enable a relaxation of the 15-acre land ceiling, in effect currently.\n\nOther announcements included a lifting of the current ban on women factory workers from being given a night shift, with the employer being made responsible for their safety. A promise was also made for increasing the financial aid from KSIDC for businesses, from Rs 35 crore to Rs 100 crore, with higher amounts also offered in exceptional cases.\n\nWith Kerala having the second-highest unemployment rate in the country, the government also plans on assigning specific targets and responsibilities to local bodies such as panchayats, to facilitate the creation of jobs and promotion of industries.\n\nHe added, “Though a small state, we have several inherent strengths that make us different, including our natural assets and highly qualified human resource. Now is the time to properly leverage them to bring in substantial investment, which is essential to generate income and employment for the present and future generations.”\n\nMA Yussufali, the chairman and managing director of Lulu Group International, also encouraged the international banking and investor community to fund projects in the state, saying, “The beneficiaries of the investment that they make now will be the future generations of Kerala.”\n\nThe summit will be held for two days, during which, around 100 projects from a variety of industries will be on display. These include tourism and hospitality, fisheries, petrochemicals, agro and food processing, infrastructure, and mobility development, among others.",

    "post_content": "Karnataka’s Central Village Pottery Institute, the only government-run pottery school in India, has been seeing a consistent rise in women students. This reflects a rising trend of women in the state foregoing traditional career paths to explore their creativity.\n\nA total of 10 women signed up for the four-month long master potter course in 2019-20. Eight of these applicants are extremely qualified individuals who were working in a number of other industries before shifting lanes. In addition, two of them are also planning to launch their own businesses, having already completed the course.\n\nThe institute has been offering pottery courses since 1963, and is operated by the Khadi Village and Industries Commission. Students from the institute are adept at moulding and baking clay utensils and artefacts, and now, exploring terracotta jewellery as well, as it has a huge demand in the international market. The institute not only teaches traditional wheel pottery and coiling, but also methods like slip-casting, pressing, jigger, and jolly, which are required for the production of large volumes.\n\nOne such individual is Deepa Shivaji Sonaji, formerly an IT professional in Bengaluru, who made a conscious decision to make a change in her life and do something she loves. She has already completed the four-month-long course and now runs her own terracotta jewellery business, in her hometown Belagavi. She says, \"I quit the IT profession to learn pottery to start my own business. There may be more money in the software industry, but not much peace. It's a thankless job. Jewellery-making not only fetches money, it brings a great amount of joy while working.\"\n\nShe frequently receives a number of orders from both Goa and Mumbai, having recently delivered 80 jewellery products to Mumbai. As such, her business and her list of clientele have been growing steadily, and in the near future, she also plans on roping in some of her l\n\nHer clientele is only growing and Deepa says she is now trying to loop in some of her batchmates once they complete the course.\n\nOne such student is Pooja Chalannavar from Belagavi, who had ranked 26th in the all-India entrance exam for MSc in agriculture. She had pursued her MSc from Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology, and despite receiving many job offers for the role of assistant professor, decided to chart her own path, instead. She said, \"I have an aptitude for wall painting and drawing. Hence, I thought I can learn this form too. Once I perfect pottery, I will set up my own business in my father's agricultural land. Many people are now looking to buy terracotta jewellery, especially in cosmopolitan cities.\"\n\nSujata, on the other hand, is a DPharm student, who, with her husband, will be establishing their own pottery unit at Desur in Belagavi. She said, \"I think pottery making will be creatively fulfilling and bring a sustainable income.\"\n\nAccording to Nagesh Govardhan, the assistant director of Khadi Village and Industries Commission, barely one or two of the students in the earlier batches were graduates or held jobs, but things are changing. He said, \"Our students this year have degrees and careers in IT, architecture, pharma, commerce etc. And all of them want to start their own pottery business.\"",

    "post_content": "NSRCEL, the academic incubator of IIM (Indian Institute of Management) Bangalore, celebrated its 20<sup>th<\/sup> year of mentoring entrepreneurs from a varying spectrum of industries, in Mumbai on Saturday. The innovation and entrepreneurial centre hosted ‘The Dialogue’, a panel discussion on ‘Bootstrapped vs Funding: what’s best for your startup?’, as part of its aim to grow its presence in Mumbai and Delhi.\n\nProfessors also stated that this will help NSRCEL increase its focus on women entrepreneurs, social ventures, start-ups in rural areas, and student-run ventures across India, professors from the institute said.\n\nVenkatesh Panchapagesan, Chair, NSRCEL at IIMB, said, “The idea is to bring together bright minds to share experiences that are idea-focused and relevant to the entrepreneur, to foster learning and to provoke conversations that count.”\n\nHe further spoke of the journey that IIMB’s open, early-stage incubator, has had, saying, “When IIMB set up NSRCEL 20 years ago, we were the only game in town. Now, there is a proliferation of players. But we stand apart not only because we provide a safe space for entrepreneurs but also because we build a body of research, build a community that supports entrepreneurs and mentor sticky stakeholders. Only a public institution like IIMB can do this.”\n\nSuresh Bhagavatula, Chair, Entrepreneurship area at IIMB, who was also the Program Director for several of its entrepreneurship programs, said, “The founder-patron of NSRCEL, Mr NS Raghavan, always wanted us to grow our presence, as an early-stage incubator, outside of Bangalore and, thanks to support from our partners and alumni, we have made a beginning here in Mumbai.”\n\nThe keynote address was given by Karthik Reddy, the co-founder and managing partner of Blume Ventures, an early-stage Indian venture fund, where he stated that he would provide a structure of funding for start-ups, recounting examples of many businesses that have explored both avenues.\n\n“The existential question for entrepreneurs, when they must choose a route, remains, ‘is this what I am signing up for?’ Entrepreneurs must ask themselves what kind of capital should be taken for what kind of outcome. They must ask themselves what is the market size and opportunity they are chasing,” he said, asking entrepreneurs to evaluate the scalability of their business before looking for a source of institutional capital.\n\nFollowing the keynote address, a panel discussion was held between Imran Jafar, Managing Partner at Gaja Capital, Vineeta Singh, CEO of SUGAR Cosmetics, Poyni Bhatt, Founding team member of SINE, the technology business incubator at IIT Bombay, and Deepa Krishnan, Founder of Magic Tours of India\n\nPoyni Bhatt spoke about the need to encourage promising young talents to pursue entrepreneurship, instead of being tempted by big paychecks at a job. She highlighted the responsibility of role models in motivating others to take risks for success. She even recalled the days of being at the receiving end of angry parents wanting to know how their children would find good marriage proposals if they traded in the security that a paycheck offers, for the thrill of a start-up!\n\nShe stated, “In order to stay relevant, an academic incubator must play to its strength, strengthen its offerings by way of its infrastructure and funding, and extend its networks.”\n\nAgreeing with her, Imran Jafar continued, “For instance, IIMB can be the custodian of Indian stories of entrepreneurship. Top B-schools should also tweak the admissions criteria to choose risk-takers rather than the risk-averse.”",

At an age when ordinary people would be bedridden, finding it increasingly difficult to stem the onslaught of ailments and dimming faculties, Kaur has chosen to be an entrepreneur, and such has been the power of her story that Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra named her as the 'entrepreneur of the year'.\n\n“When you hear the word ‘start-up’ it brings to mind images of millennials in Silicon Valley or Bengaluru trying to build billion dollar ‘unicorns.’ From now on let’s also include a 94-yr-old woman who doesn’t think it’s too late to do a start-up,” Mahindra wrote on Twitter. As of January 9, 2020, the tweet has garnered over 2,000 retweets and over 11,000 likes, spreading Kaur's story far and wide.\n\nKaur started her journey four years ago and with the help and encouragement of her daughter, established a brand called 'Harbhajan's', making organic besan ki barfi, yourstory.com reported. Kaur's daughter then sells them at the organic mandi in Chandigarh.\n\n“She is so talented in cooking, in our childhood we never went out to eat. She made everything at home - sweets, chocolates, sharbat, etc.,” Kaur's daughter said. She added that her mother excelled in making besan ki barfi and every winter, she used to make them for the entire family.\n\nKaur is truly one of the strongest examples that age is just a number.",

This has helped in addressing the problems of malnutrition and illiteracy.\n\nThe Sahachari Foundation has also supported the Victoria Memorial School for the Blind to provide education and training across various skillsets to visually challenged boys so that they become self-sufficient. The Sahachari Foundation has helped to construct the school's dining hall.\n\nThe foundation gets financial support from both private individuals and corporations who participate in special events organised by the foundation.\n\nSome of the charities supported by the Sahachari Foundation are Aangan, which helps more than 20,000 girls from economically depressed backgrounds by providing them vocational training and livelihood opportunities; Aashray, which gives homes to senior citizens so that they can live their lives with dignity; Nanhi Kali, to educate girls from underprivileged communities; SOS Children Villages, which gives orphans a family environment and provides them education, medical facilities and vocational training; Sakha Cabs, which trains women drivers and caters exclusively to women passengers to ensure women's safety; Vandana Foundation, which provides micro-finance for women; and others.\n\nTherefore, though the word 'Sahachari' can be translated as 'women walking together', it has been said that it is much more than that. It is a glowing example of the many miles in social service that women can go when they walk together.",

These parameters relate to women's access to healthcare, household infrastructure like toilets and LPG cylinders, and educational and professional avenues, their ability to take decisions in the family, their economic empowerment among others.\n\nThe yardstick has been modelled on the Good Governance Index recently released by the government and is the first to be dedicated exclusively to assess the degree of women empowerment in the country.\n\nNiti Aayog sources said that the Union ministries of women and child development, human resource development and health have been asked to provide their inputs within three months. The idea was first conceived by Niti Aayog in its strategy document last year.\n\nTo begin with, the WISE index will rely on existing government data, for instance, those from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). No new data will be compiled for now and the ministries need to send in existing data on the decided criteria.",

    "post_content": "Union Minister of Commerce and Industry &amp; Railways, Piyush Goyal, said during a meeting in New Delhi that the MSME (Micro Small and Medium Enterprises) sector is significantly well equipped to adapt to the export market and the many changes it is undergoing. The meeting was held on January 6<sup>th<\/sup> for the minister to hold discussions with MSME associations regarding several issues plaguing the industry, and how best to address them.\n\nSeveral important issues were put on the table through the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM), SME Chamber of India, and the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry. These included the challenges that SME units face in accessing credit from banks, delay of payments from Public Sector Units and Government departments, GST refund, lack of skilled manpower in the SME sector, disparity in wages in states across the country, and many more.\n\nThe Indian MSME sector currently provides employment to more than 100 million people, and is responsible for close to 45% of the country’s manufacturing output and over 40% of its exports. With around 63.4 million such units in operation all over the country, the sector is responsible for contributing to roughly 6.11% of the manufacturing GDP and 24.63% of the GDP from service activities.\n\nThe minister instructed the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and the Credit Guarantee Funds Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) to create a framework that cuts down the time needed to process loans to SME units, besides providing insurance cover to SME exporters.\n\nHe also addressed manufacturers in the sector, emphasising the need to produce high quality goods that adhere to international standards, so that exports from the sector can also become a part of the global value chain.\n\nIn addition, he also discussed the capability of big companies to make complete payment to SMEs against the delivery, so that their working capital is not blocked.\n\nHe also suggested that the Government e-Marketplace could provide guidance to women led SMEs and onboard them on the GeM portal, to bring the 8 million Indian women running their own businesses into the mainstream fold. He assured the sector that the government would provide all necessary support for the upskilling of members in the sector.",

The association aims to add around 1,000 members by 2023, and has hence, asked Indian Bank to provide skill training to them, according to their interests and choices.",

    "post_content": "The government of India is planning to form a committee of some of the biggest personalities in the Indian startup and technology ecosystem, which will provide advice and knowhow on developing its rapidly-growing digital economy and combating persistent challenges.\n\nThe Startup Advisory Council will be made up of Bhavish Aggarwal, founder of ride-hailing firm Ola, Byju Raveendran, founder of ed-tech platform Byju’s, Nandan Nilekani and Kris Gopalakrishnan, cofounders of Infosys, and several prominent global and home-grown venture capital investors, such as Siddarth Pai, the founding partner of 3one4 Capital.\n\nIn addition, the Council will also have several government officials and regulators representing it. A senior government official said, “It was felt that there should be a structured way in which the government engages with startups at regular intervals. So, we’re arranging the concerned people who deal with startups from the relevant ministries, people from the startup ecosystem — be it entrepreneurs, investors and thought leaders.”\n\nThe plan for creating the council was discussed at the 2019 Global Venture Capital Summit in December, organised by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and the Goa government.\n\nThe two-day summit saw several closed-door meetings between industry representatives and policymakers, where veterans in the industry discussed their requirements and expectations from the lawmakers.\n\nAccording to reports, the private equity and venture capital industry in India had asked domestic pension funds to allocate 1% of their total assets to alternative investment funds, last month. It had also suggested creating a number of startup-focused fund-of-funds powered by the government, in order to leverage such investments.\n\nFurthermore, the Indian Venture Capital Association (IVCA) has also asked for tax breaks to be provided as incentives for creating such pools of domestic capital. The first meeting of the council is supposed to be held before the upcoming Union Budget, which is expected to address several issues plaguing the startup sector. The chief among these will include exempting investors from capital gains tax in order to promote redeployment of capital into startups, and taxation of employee stock ownership plans (Esops) only when the sale takes place, instead of when the shares are vested.\n\nThe initiative to set up the Startup Advisory Council is in line with the DPIIT’s Startup India Vision 2024, which has laid out a number of possible steps to reduce compliance time for startups, and improve regulatory requirements for entrepreneurs. It also enumerates a number of measures to promote startups, such as setting up 500 incubators and accelerators, enhancing debt financing facilities, and deploying the entire corpus of Rs 10,000 crore fund-of-funds.\n\nReports also state that DPIIT has been in discussion with finance and corporate affairs ministries, the Sebi and the RBI, regarding multiple regulatory changes with regards to startups.\n\nDPIIT secretary Guruprasad Mohapatra had said, “We are working on regulatory changes that would aim at easier incorporation of a company, easier compliances, reduction of tax compliance to less than one hour per month.”",

    "post_content": "More and more women are today choosing to be professional chauffeurs, as a way of taking control of their lives. Driving everything from cars and two-wheelers to even buses and more, these women are often driven by a need to look for fresh career opportunities, besides their financial need. As a result, they are rapidly smashing gender barriers and exploring a career in the high-demand industry.\n\nAccording to the latest report by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the Road Transport Yearbook 2015-16, women had made up only 1.5 crore of the over 16 crore valid drivers' licences issued in India, as of March 31, 2016. Out of these 1.5 crore women, only 17.73 per cent drove professionally. Today, that number is increasing fast.\n\nHowever, this wave of women drivers is not just being seen in big cities. Smaller towns are also starting to see this 'drive' towards change. A spokesman from the body said that a significant increase had been seen in the number of women fleet operators over the last few years, driving four-wheelers, three-wheelers, and even two-wheelers.\n\nNo exact numbers were available for professional women drivers at Ola and Uber, as both companies refused to divulge details. But Delhi-based NGO Azad foundation is working tirelessly to provide livelihoods for resource-poor women in India and make the country safer for women. The foundation has launched a 'Women on Wheels' programme, aimed at empowering women with minimal economic and social capital, to help them become professional drivers.\n\nAlthough seeing a woman chauffeur might help many women customers feel safer, their own safety and security must also be ensured. Hence, Susmitha from the Foundation, said, \"Besides imparting the training to drive a car, the foundation also trains the women to address technical glitches with the vehicle on the road. To ensure their safety, we have collaborated with the Delhi Police to train them in self-defence.\"",

    "post_content": "Renowned architect Brinda Somaya is all set to curate the ‘Women in Design 2020+' international conference, which will see more than 35 women in architecture and design from all over the world share their stories. This is the second such conference she is about to launch, as she had organised a similar one, twenty years ago, where women architects from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan had converged to speak about their accomplishments.\n\nAt her first conference, in 2000, a common question from several men was, “Are we allowed?” Hoping the question has been answered by now, she prepares for the launch of the conference, at the Nehru Centre, on January 8<sup>th<\/sup>, set to go on till the 10<sup>th<\/sup>.\n\nSomaya said, “I hope there are more men in the audience than there were back in 2000. I want the conference to be an equalizer.” She emphasised that it is vital for everyone to listen to and celebrate the accomplishments of women in architecture, design, and other creative fields, battling countless stereotypes and challenges in establishing an independent office. She also added, “We’ve invited speakers from every continent except Antarctica.”\n\nThe conference was organised by Somaya's firm, in association with The HECAR Foundation, a non-profit organisation that aims to educate the general public about architecture, heritage, and several contemporary urban issues. The event features discussions among prominent architects like Abha Narain Lambah, Shimul Javeri Kadri, and Annabelle Selldorf, a German architect who had launched her firm in New York City in 1988. The speakers will also include Billie Tsein, from Tod Williams Billie Tsein Architects, the Manhattan Studio that designed the Obama Presidential Centre in Chicago, and Joana Dabaj from London, who has rebuilt several camps in war-torn Syria.\n\nReportedly, the idea of organising a follow up to her 2000 conference came to Somaya when she and her daughter Nandini were working on a book that catalogues their works. This reminded her of the first event, for which, Somaya had invited Yasmeen Laari, the first woman architect of Pakistan. Along with providing immense networking opportunities and guidance, the conference also led to a book being published and workshops being conducted for women professionals looking to return to work, after motherhood.\n\nThis inspired her, and she decided to leverage her own personal connections to have speakers brought down who would speak about their works and thoughts this year. In addition to that, an exhibition titled '20 Year Manifesto' will also be organised at the Goethe-Institut Max Mueller Bhavan, highlighting several practices led by women from a wide number of creative fields.",

The objective of the expo was to create employment opportunities for enterprising women in the MSME sectors, thereby encouraging women entrepreneurship.\n\nThe expo had close to 100 stalls with various decorative items, foods, clothing and dress materials, jewellery, wooden articles, bamboo products, herbal products\/medicines, bags, spices, pickles, and more, on display.\n\nIt also consisted of a number of competitions, sports, and cultural events, which were intended to bring out \"the hidden talents among women\". In addition, technical officials were also present to inform the participants about the various government schemes\/incentives available for the MSME sector.\n\nRepresentatives of banks, DIC, and more, conducted incisive sessions about the opportunities for women entrepreneurs, along with guidance on marketing, packaging, and export of products.\n\nP.M. Parlewar, the Director of MSMEDI, inaugurated the expo, with NGO Rangaresha Founder Vishakha Rao, as the guest of honour.\n\nSeveral other prominent personalities also addressed sessions and events, such as Bhawna Janbandhu, Vijayashree Khanorkar, Rahul Mishra, Rachana Wazalwar, S.R. Masram, and Maithili Kowe, besides an entertainment show by Smita Khangan on the last day of the expo.\n\nAn official from the expo spoke about the fact that the vital role that MSMEs play in a country's national economic development, has become increasingly evident, with India having become a definitive \"testing ground\" for emerging Indian women entrepreneurs.\n\nHe added, \"Indian women are not only educated, but talented, confidently assertive, ambitious, career oriented and independent-minded with good managerial skills and risk-taking abilities.

    "post_content": "Brides in Assam who are 18 years and above, hold at least a matriculation degree, and whose annual family income (combined income of the bride and her parents) is not beyond Rs 5 lakh, will now get Rs 30,000 as assistance from the state government so that they can purchase gold during marriage. This innovative scheme named Arundhati has been planned to address the problem of child marriage and empower women.\n\nAssam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the scheme has been approved by the state cabinet and is slated to come into effect from January 1, 2020, according to a report in India Today. The scheme will cost the state exchequer Rs 800 crore annually.\n\n\"Assam government has decided in our budget that we will give one tola (10g) of gold to the bride if a marriage is solemnised and registered,\" Sharma said.\n\n\"Now any marriage which will be registered, the bride will get Rs 30,000 from the state government to purchase gold. But, to have benefit from the scheme, your minimum age has to be 18 years (for brides) and 21 years (for bridegrooms) and you have to be a matriculate,\" he added.\n\nBenefits under the scheme can be availed when a marriage is formally registered under the Special Marriage (Assam) Rules, 1954.\n\nSharma said that the scheme emphasises on establishing the \"correct age of marriage\" in Assam and also create \"a society full of educated boys and girls\".\n\nThe scheme has been devised in such a way that assistance reaches the beneficiaries right in time for a social marriage. Talking about the investment in gold, Sharma pointed out that gold has a value that goes up and that it is a security.\n\nThe benefits of the scheme will be confined to the first marriage only.\n\nThe minimum educational qualification has been initially relaxed for the tea garden and adivasi tribes.\n\nIn Assam, on an average, 3 lakh marriages take place every year and out of them, only 50,000-55,000 marriages have been registered.",

    "post_content": "A parliamentary watchdog in Bangladesh has called for stringent steps to stop the torture and harassment of Bangladeshi women workers in foreign lands.\n\nAt a meeting at the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban in November 2019, the parliamentary standing committee asked the Bangladesh foreign ministry to take the issue very seriously and emphasised that not even a single case of harassment should be tolerated, The Daily Star reported.\n\nBangladesh Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen pointed out that around six lakh Bangladeshi women were working abroad, and out of them, around 2.5 lakh were in Saudi Arabia. He added that out of the total number of Bangladeshi women working abroad, around 1% (6,000) face torture and harassment.\n\nThe harassment of Bangladeshi women workers is a cause for concern particularly in Saudi Arabia and some other countries. The parliamentary body has advised the Sheikh Hasina government to take effective steps to curb this menace, especially in view of its prevalence in places like Saudi Arabia.\n\nAccording to the committee, personal information on female workers ought to be collected from the expatriate welfare ministry before these workers are sent abroad so that their condition can be monitored.\n\nHowever, foreign ministry officials revealed that the expatriate welfare ministry did not inform them about the female workers after sending them abroad. It is only after a victim informed the Bangladesh mission that incidents of torture are known, Momen said. The foreign ministry officials also pointed towards irregularities taking place while sending female workers abroad, including sending job seekers aged below 14 and above 65 abroad.\n\nIn order to address this issue, the Bangladesh government is planning to set up hotline numbers at different Bangladesh missions abroad. These numbers would be given to all female migrant workers, who would be able to dial the numbers and seek help if they faced any trouble.\n\nForeign ministry officials also mentioned that following communications from them, several Saudi nationals have been booked by the law enforcement authorities of that country over the torture of women workers from Bangladesh.\n\nA large number of Bangladesh lawmakers had demanded an end to sending women workers to Saudi Arabia after bodies of several hundred female workers were sent back from Saudi Arabia. According to the Brac Migration Programme, Bangladesh received bodies of 311 women workers from the Gulf countries, mostly Saudi Arabia, between 2016 and June 2019.\n\nHowever, the parliamentary panel agreed with the foreign ministry that it would not be prudent to stop sending women workers abroad considering the massive foreign remittances sent home by these migrant workers.\n\nA committee member highlighted that a female worker sends home about 90% of her monthly income against 60% by a male worker. Therefore, bringing female migrant workers home would significantly cut Bangladesh's income from foreign remittances.",

The approved budget for the pilot project is Rs 12 crores.\n\nIn order to promote entrepreneurship in the country, the government recently awarded 30 young entrepreneurs and six organisations\/individuals, who are building an entrepreneurship eco-system in the country. The awards were presented to honour outstanding contributions in entrepreneurship development. The awards included a trophy, a certificate, and prize money up to Rs 10 lakhs. This was done in order to promote entrepreneurship amongst the youth, so as to create more job givers than job seekers in the nation.",

The workshop was attended by the officials from the State Urban Livelihoods Missions, State Skill Development Missions, and other partners, besides the officials from the Ministry.\n\nThe deliberations in the workshop are expected to bring out the best course of action from the state and other partners to organise the ensuing Shehri Samridhi Utsav, to achieve the goals set out. In addition to providing access to a wider customer base to locally made products of SHGs, the initiative will also be useful in capacity building of women entrepreneurs, in the skills of branding, digital marketing, and financial management.\n\nThe SSU 2019 succeeded in extending the outreach of the mission to the most vulnerable sections of the urban population, showcasing its initiatives, and facilitating access to Self-Help Group (SHG) members to other government schemes, by covering over 15.60 lakh members from urban SHGs.",

The report states that corporations can help by linking new ventures to their supply chain, and by mentoring and coaching entrepreneurs on best business practices.\n\nA range of stakeholders — including government and entrepreneurial companies — would need to help develop and in some cases, deliver new solutions, recommends PWC. The entrepreneurial sector must therefore also play a major role; it has the nimbleness in operations and the depth in ideas to create the kind of radical new solutions required for a vibrant future of the economy.\n\nEntrepreneurs and the entrepreneurial sector as a whole also possess other qualities critical for developing innovative solutions: the willingness to take risks, an aptitude for fast decision-making, and bold leadership, suggest the report.\n\nIt further recommends that the entrepreneurial sector will also need to expand, in both size and impact. India must cultivate entrepreneurs on a scale unprecedented in its business history. Furthermore, the notion of entrepreneurialism should not be limited to growth-oriented companies rooted in India’s major urban centres. Entrepreneurialism must also percolate into smaller towns and districts, throughout the country.",

To tap these facets to benefit a wider audience, Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management, IIT Bombay, India, and College of Business, University of North Texas, USA, are jointly organising the 2nd International Conference on Entrepreneurship &amp; Family Business (ICEFB) 2020, on January 09-11, 2020, in Mumbai.\n\nIt will discuss in detail the aspects of social entrepreneurship, which has been instrumental in reshaping social norms and improving the well-being of all. In particular, the increased involvement of women in entrepreneurship and family-owned businesses, has helped shape the business landscape. Participants at the conference will have the opportunity to explore, expound on, and extend the rich heritage of research on entrepreneurship and family business.\n\nThe conference will host a mix of academic professionals, institutional policymakers, business leaders, and practitioners. Entrepreneurial and family-owned enterprises are gaining prominence in academic and business circles. Hence, the renaissance of entrepreneurial and family business enterprises in India makes it an ideal location for the conference.\n\nThe influence of entrepreneurial and family-owned businesses on the wealth of nations is well-documented. Many of these are small and medium-sized businesses. Successful Indian entrepreneurs and family business owners lead fast-growing enterprises, many of which have gone public, on to the world stage. The academic workshop has also been proposed during the two-day event.\n\nThe workshops will be held on the following topics: Emerging topics in entrepreneurship and family business research, Methodological issues in entrepreneurship research and entrepreneurship, Teaching entrepreneurship and family business, along with research trends in social entrepreneurship, ICEFB offers a convenient platform to kindle engagement and productive discourse on these important issues.",

    "post_content": "Bank of Baroda recently entered into a partnership with the Gujarat government to enable credit inflow to the MSME sector for several entrepreneurial projects in underdeveloped areas. The MoU signed on December 20, under the Gujarat Single Window Clearance Act 2017 &amp; Ordinance Number 1 of 2019 dated October 24, 2019, will facilitate greenfield projects, startups, women entrepreneurs and more from such areas to avail the credit facility.\n\nCustomers will need to register their request via the Gujarat government’s single window portal, which will then be submitted to Bank of Baroda for review and processing.\n\nTo this end, the bank has also set up a dedicated central processing cell in Mumbai and Gujarat, which will handle the leads and requests on a priority basis, in order to ensure that the in-principle approval\/decision is made available within 30 days from the date of submission.\n\nExecutive director of Bank of Baroda Vikramaditya Singh Khichi, commented on the partnership, saying, “The MoU with the Gujarat government is a step forward for MSME entrepreneurs. For a state known for its entrepreneurial spirit, this initiative will provide banking solutions and financial support to generate employment opportunities. It is a matter of pride for Bank of Baroda to be part of this initiative and to contribute to the national objectives.”\n\nVijay Rupani, the chief minister of Gujarat, said, “The state government is committed to support the MSME sector in the state for economic development and this is a major initiative taken by the government whereby exemption has been provided to the entrepreneurs from certain approvals and inspections, before establishment of units. This MoU would speed up the process of credit offtake as well as industrial development.”\n\nThe bank has stated that it will process the applications on a real-time basis, and the in-principle approval\/decision of the lead will be conveyed through the portal, the district level nodal agency, or the state level nodal agency, to facilitate seamless operation.",

    "post_content": "Jyoti Wadhwa was concerned when her husband Anshul decided to quit his job as an investment banker and start something on his own. Anshul Bansal was the sole earning member of the family and Jyoti knew that considering the risk her husband was going to take, she had to contribute financially as well.\n\n“I figured I have to do something but at the same time, I did not want to leave my daughter in a playschool. I was looking for options where I could work from home,” Jyoti was quoted as saying by Yourstory.com.\n\nJyoti had worked in the HR and admin departments of an MNC for three years before her marriage, and so was not totally unaware about work culture. He had provided her Rs 50,000 from his saving of Rs 1 lakh. Jyoti's relatives suggested that selling vintage sarees online would be a viable option.\n\nJyoti studied the market for five to six hours every day, trying to understand customer behaviour. She knew that with her Rs 50,000 corpus, she had to be selective and prudent. She found that there was a demand for printed pure silk fabrics and soon came across handcrafted sarees. She selected some products and uploaded them on eBay and it led to the establishment of her brand Sanskriti Vintage.\n\nInitially, Jyoti had to do the shipping from the postal services herself, standing in queues with her young daughter for three-four hours. Though pure silk embroidered sarees were being sold online, none of her rivals sold hand-crafted embroidered sarees, and that proved to be the differentiator for her business. Her rivals were acquiring old sarees and selling them at a small margin. Realising that she can't compete in the price game, Jyoti decided to stick to premium products, investing in good photography, lights, and a DSLR camera.\n\nWhat has also worked for Jyoti is her adaptability and flexibility of approach. When after three-four years, her eBay market plateaued, she moved over to Amazon in 2013. However, she soon understood that it was not the platform for her existing products. That led her to start a fashion jewellery line called Zephyrr, which soon became a “best seller” on Amazon.\n\nWhat started with an investment of Rs 50,000 soon became a Rs 10 crore business and from running the show all by herself, Jyoti has come a long way today, employing 30 people, most of them being women. In 2015, she was given the Niryat Shree award from the President of India. It is given to 50 chosen exporters every two years for contribution to exports from India.\n\nWhat started as an effort to support the family has grown into a flourishing business that supports many other families and the country's exports.",

    "post_content": "India, one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, is one of the laggards when it comes to female participation in organisations and businesses. The country has been ranked a lowly 52nd on the Mastercard Index for Women Entrepreneurs for the third consecutive year, according to a report in Business Insider.\n\nIndia's ranking is way behind those of rival economies China, which is ranked 6th, and the US, which tops the list. What's worse, India's ranking witnessed a decline in terms of the rate of women entrepreneurial activity, which stood at 58.6 points.\n\nThe index points out that women perform better in markets like Singapore, Australia and others where the labour participation rate is comparatively higher. In India, the participation rate of women in the labour force is only 15% in urban areas.\n\nThe report identifies gender bias, paucity of funding and several other factors as obstacles in the path of women entrepreneurs in developing economies.\n\nMastercard has been working with government organisations, NGOs and industry bodies to provide tools and networks to support women entrepreneurs and help them to become part of the digital economy, pointed out Vikas Verma, Chief Operating Officer at Mastercard. Government of India has tied up with Mastercard and NGOs like Mann Deshi and Industree Foundation to support women entrepreneurs.\n\nMastercard is known to have introduced programmes like Start Path and Fintech Express to support start-ups at the global level. It has also contributed to the growth of start-ups like Razorpay, Zeta and ToneTag.",

    "post_content": "It is not easy to be a woman entrepreneur. It is not simply a question of entering domains that were considered exclusive to males and engaging in activities that only males were held to have the capability to carry out. Women have been breaking into male bastions pretty regularly, but even when they do, they find their paths riddled with thorns. And this happens as a result of society's attitude towards women that no amount of modern education and awareness has been able to improve fully.\n\nFor a woman entrepreneur, therefore, problems arise at the level of funding too where there is a clear gender bias. Financial Express cited a recent study to show that less than 3% of the global venture capital was invested in women-led teams in 2017. For emerging markets, the figure is slightly better, but not much. In these markets, 7% of the private equity and venture capital funding goes to female-led businesses.\n\nThis is apart from the derogatory sexist remarks women entrepreneurs have to face. They are often asked if they have a male co-founder, ignored in favour of male members of the team, and made to clarify childbearing plans. At every step, she is made to realise that it is not easy for society to accept her presence in a predominantly male realm.\n\nUsually, the willingness of an investor to support women-led businesses is correlated to the presence of women and gender balance in the investor’s team. These are hard to find in the private equity and venture capital industry which suffers from very low levels of gender diversity at both regional and global levels. According to the study quoted by Financial Express, only 11% of senior investment professionals in these investment firms are women and only 15% of senior investment teams possess gender balance (which means they have one-third or more female members).\n\nIt is extremely difficult for women-led businesses to raise subsequent funding. When they do succeed in getting subsequent funding it is because the female lead has been replaced by a man. So even when they get initial funding, women-led businesses find that the going gets significantly tougher in the long run.\n\nAccordingly, there are only a few women entrepreneurs who are really successful. The National Sample Survey reports that 14% of businesses in India are run by female entrepreneurs – of these, more than 70% have an annual turnover of up to Rs 10 lakh and employ five people or less.\n\nA solution to this could be women-only funds and funds that will invest only in female-led businesses. But the lack of a sufficient number of candidates makes it a slightly challenging commercial proposition. Another approach involves special initiatives for women entrepreneurs including access to finance, mentorship and capacity building.",

    "post_content": "Today, women in India are just as capable and employable as men. However, a number of critical sectors, such as automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare continue to lag behind in female workforce participation.\n\nAccording to the ‘India Skills Report 2020’, the last two years have seen female employability in the country improve by as much as 9%, from 38% in 2017 to 47% in 2019. The gender-wise employability rates have also become nearly equal, at 46% for men and 47% for women.\n\nDespite this, India is currently one of 10 countries in the world which have the lowest female labour force participation rate. Additionally, women in India also receive significantly lower remuneration for the same job, compared to men.\n\nThe report states, “The increase in the number of job-ready women presents an opportunity for India Inc to harness their talent and engage more women in jobs as this is the most essential step in filling the skill gaps in the country.”\n\nThe survey showed that while BPO, KPO, IT, and BFSI (Banking, Financial Services &amp; Insurance) sectors boast of the highest women’s contribution, at more than 30%, the automotive and healthcare sectors have the lowest contribution by women. This shows that the overall female participation rate in the country is still incredibly low. In fact, the men to women ratio in the corporate world is extremely unbalanced, and skewed unfairly, at 71:29.\n\nTherefore, in the years to come, organisations must redouble their efforts and focus on hiring more women, in order to efficiently leverage the potential they possess, and create actualised gender parity.",

Her grandfather was a well-known textile businessman from Amritsar. She spent years learning and designing home textiles and sarees for top fashion brands like House of Fraser, John Lewis, Galleries Lafayette Printemps, Laura Ashley, Tommy Hilfiger, and Satya Paul.\n\nWhen she married Praveen, she found that their interests matched. Praveen, who was from Jammu, was passionate about shawl-making, and Varuna, with her expertise in textile designing, could be of great support. Praveen was keen on starting a project on shawl-making. It was called Splendour of Kashmir, and Praveen wanted to start this for his wife in 2011 and also spread awareness about the local art and craft of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nHowever, Praveen passed away in 2012. He was always confident that Varuna would be able to market the shawls well. Varuna plunged into the business in 2012 and invested around Rs 15 lakh. She promised to provide a comprehensive range of curated shawls.\n\nShawl-making is the largest cottage industry of Jammu and Kashmir that involves a large part of the local population. Varuna hopes to provide work and revenue to the locals and touch a large number of lives in the region through her business.\n\nVaruna said that women are an integral part of the shawl-making industry. She pointed out that the government runs training centres to help women learn the art of Kani shawl-weaving, and it is no longer a male domain. Today, women are involved in embroidery, spinning, and sorting of the yarn, she said.\n\nVaruna confessed that she was very insecure about carrying on with this venture. She had been sheltered a lot by her husband and never felt she could carry this venture forward without his support. She shared that her greatest high was when her work was acknowledged by connoisseurs and she was given the outstanding woman entrepreneur award by a large media group.",

Dhaaga stores sell handicraft products made by these women and the sale proceeds go to support these women financially.\n\nDhaaga now has its first store in Delhi which was launched in collaboration with Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd (TPDDL).\n\nThe Dhaaga movement started in 2017 with just 15 women in Kamshet village of Pune district in Maharashtra, where a self-help group and a modern garment unit was set up. Dhaaga stores today exist in 16 locations across the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, and Odisha. However, Dhaaga is not merely a store. It is a movement.\n\nIn 2018-19, an order value of Rs 37 lakh was being managed by about 1,050 women. Region-specific arts and crafts such as Kutchee handicrafts in Mundra, Gujarat and Tiger Grass Handicrafts in Maithon, Jharkhand is being promoted.\n\nAccording to Shalini Singh, Chief (Corporate Communications and Sustainability), Tata Power, gender equality and women empowerment have been high on the company's agenda. \"Seeing these women blossom into confident individuals, makes us strive harder to create an environment devoid of the inequalities faced by them,\" she said.",

According to the study quoted by Yourstory.com, 48% of Indian women quit work midway to take care of familial commitments.\n\nThis may be seen in the backdrop of a National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) report that the participation of women in the workforce fell from 36% to 24% over the past decade.\n\nThe Avtar survey studied a sample of 783 second-career women from across industries and sectors with an average work experience of 9.5 years and a career break of 4.4 years. Out of these, 45% of the women found it difficult to balance motherhood and work and hence took a break, 35% took breaks that were induced by maternity, while 16% had to put care for the elderly at home over continuing in office.\n\nThis highlights the plight of working mothers, who invariably have to juggle work and household chores, parenting, care for the elderly, and generally, keeping the house in order. What often happens in this struggle is that work and careers take the backseat. This, therefore, leads one to ask: why should motherhood and family commitments be a sort of 'penalty' on working women?\n\nWhat is worse, second career women often lack support at home. According to the Avtar report, 23% of the second career women get insufficient support from their families, 59% lack a strong network and 36% are faced with skill gaps.\n\nThe report also finds that almost 69% of the respondents upskilled themselves during the break and almost 66% have had mentoring. Close to 69% anticipate pay cuts on re-entering their careers. This clearly shows the difficulties faced by career women and the injustice done to them by society fixing certain roles for them.\n\nFounder-President of AVTAR Group Saundarya Rajesh said that the country requires more companies across segments and geographies to implement women-friendly policies. This will not only help these companies improve their overall performance, but also improve India’s position on the global women workforce map, she said.",

HPWE are those who want to grow and scale their businesses. Cities included in the WE Cities rankings already have thriving commercial entrepreneurship.\n\nStrong entrepreneurship is not necessarily a strength for women entrepreneurs.  But entrepreneurs are the force that leads the economy and women business owners in 2009 made up the fifth largest GDP, but still struggled to access the capital, networks and resources they need to take their businesses to the next level point the report.\n\nThe computer hardware major Dell is committed to accelerating the increasingly powerful role that women play in driving global economic growth. Through the Dell Women’s Entrepreneur Network (DWEN), Dell is facilitating women entrepreneurs to connect across the globe with networks, sources of capital, knowledge and technology, giving them the power to do more.\n\nAspiring and established women entrepreneurs from India can join other female business leaders from around the globe via Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn as Dell celebrate the impact of women-owned businesses on the global economy.\n\nThe Dell Women’s Entrepreneur Network DWEN Summit 2019  will bring together 200 of the most inspiring female entrepreneurs, international media and Dell executives for two days of collaboration thought leadership and networking.\n\nThis year the summit will be held at Utrecht, The Netherlands (about 20 miles outside of Amsterdam) on December 2-3, 2019.\n\nThe event has grown into a thriving international network with hundreds of women business owners who connect throughout the year to share their knowledge and support their peers in accelerating business growth.",

    "post_content": "A survey by DDI India shows that only 40 percent of women at the individual contributor level pursue first-time leadership jobs. This indicates that gender gaps in the country begin early, with a further 34% decrease at the frontline leader level, and a sharp fall to only 12 percent at the C-suite candidates level.\n\nTitled ‘India’s First-Time Leader Report’, the survey evaluated data from as many as 2,063 respondents from various sectors, all over the country. While the prevailing sentiment is that millennials favour digital learning platforms over classrooms, the report shows that 66 percent of Indian millennial leaders actually prefer formal learning in a classroom setting.\n\nThe survey showed that Indian leaders have been unable to receive the kind of learning and development that can help them achieve success in their businesses. It also showed that half of the frontline leaders surveyed want to receive more guidance and training from their current managers, while 67 percent stated that they require more external coaching than what they were receiving at the moment. 27 percent of first-level managers, on the other hand, felt that their developmental requirements were not being met by their leaders.\n\nFurthermore, 56 percent of respondents stated that they have also never had a mentor and severely lacked guidance, even besides lacking formal training. The study also shed light on the roots of this gender gap, as women make up less than one-fifth of all frontline leadership roles,during the first four years of their career at their organisations.\n\nIn addition, the results also showed that women frontline leadershave a median of five direct reports, while male frontline leaders have seven. When it comes to growth in leadership, women earlier accounted for 40 percent of all individual contributor candidates seeking first-time leader jobs, which has now reduced to only 12 percent of women holding C-suite positions.\n\nIn fact, this shows that women are increasingly losing out on opportunities to grow in their careers, resulting in the early birth of gender gaps, even before a woman takes up her first frontline managerial role.",

C-Camp is an all-India platform where bio-entrepreneurs from all over the country can present their innovative ventures, ideas,and propositions, in the fields of Life Sciences and biotech.\n\nA total cash prize of Rs 3 crore,along with investment opportunities, was awarded to the winners, who would also be able to receive mentorship from leading industry personalities, according to a press statement by C-CAMP.\n\nCMD of Biocon,Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, the chief guest and grand jury member for the event, said that the key to leveraging the potential and impact of these ideas, they would need to be scaled up rapidly.\n\n“I have deep gratitude to C-CAMP for having brought a platform as unique as NBEC to Indian bio entrepreneurship arena. NBEC is about celebrating new ideas and the potential impact these ideas can make to society. But an entrepreneurship is about how you monetise an idea and take it to market. So don’t wait for the perfect idea. Wait for that one good idea. Shape its commercialisation journey and scale it up. Because impact and true recognition lie only in scaling,\" she said.\n\nDepartment of Biotechnology secretary, Renu Swarup, said, \"NBEC 2019 has witnessed 3000 applications, a number rising every year, clearly indicative of a maturing ecosystem. The purpose of this competition is to attract innovators, potential entrepreneurs who have in them a risk-taking appetite to try and convert an innovative idea to an impactful entrepreneurship venture. The fact that applications have been received from places like Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Daman and Diu show that we have been able to enthuse young researchers and innovators across India.\"",

    "post_content": "The World Economic Forum’s Gender Gap Report, published on Tuesday, showed that India has fallen by four places, from its 108<sup>th<\/sup> position, to rank 112<sup>th<\/sup> on the global gender gap index. The country fared poorly in women’s health and survival and economic participation, thereby ranking in the bottom-five positions in both categories.\n\nWhile Iceland continues to be the most gender-neutral country in the world, India is now lagging behind China (106<sup>th<\/sup>), Sri Lanka (102<sup>nd<\/sup>), Nepal (101<sup>st<\/sup>), Brazil (92<sup>nd<\/sup>), Indonesia (85<sup>th<\/sup>), and Bangladesh (50<sup>th<\/sup>). The last three positions are occupied by Pakistan (151<sup>st<\/sup>), Iraq (152<sup>nd<\/sup>), and Yemen (153<sup>rd<\/sup>).\n\nIndia had held the 98<sup>th<\/sup> position in the first gender gap report published by WEF, in 2006. However, since then, itsscorehas worsened in some of the categories that were evaluated to derive the final ranking. While India now ranks18<sup>th<\/sup> in political empowerment, it has slipped to the 150th position in health and survival, 149th in economic participation and opportunity, and 112th in educational attainment.\n\nThe report shows that economic opportunities for women in India are significantly low in India, at 35.4 %, along with representation on company boards, at 13.8 %. India also has low sex ratios at birth,averaging at 91 girls for every 100 boys. Furthermore, only 25% of women are active members of the country’s labour force, compared to 82 % of men. This has earned India one of the lowest ranks, globally, at the 145<sup>th<\/sup> position.\n\nIn addition, the estimated earned income for women is only one-fifth of the male income, which has also earned it a rank among the world’s lowest, at the 144<sup>th<\/sup> position. Women also occupy only 14 % of leadership positions, and 30 % of professional and technical positions.\n\nThe reason behind its much more favourable ranking in political empowerment is that the country had been headed by a woman for 20 of the last 50 years, and female political representation in the country today is as low as 14.4 % of Parliament and 23 % of the cabinet, earning it the 122<sup>nd<\/sup> and 69<sup>th<\/sup> ranks, globally.\n\nKlaus Schwab,the founder and executive chairman of WEF, said, “Supporting gender parity is critical to ensuring strong, cohesive and resilient societies around the world. For business, too, diversity will be an essential element to demonstrate that stakeholder capitalism is the guiding principle.”",

    "post_content": "A three-day-long women entrepreneurship development programme was launched in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tawang district on Wednesday. The programme has been organised by the Department of Industries, Tawang, and is being conducted at District Industries centre. The programme was inaugurated by Shri Lobsang Tsering, Addl DC, Tawang, with 25 women entrepreneurs set to attend the event. The CDPO of Tawang and HDFC’s Tawang Branch Manager were invited to be the resource persons for the event.\n\nTsering Drema, the Assistant Director of Industries, announced in her welcome address for the inaugural session, stated that a number of entrepreneur development programmes have been conducted by the Government, since 2006, to battle the social inequality that women face, and empower them through skill development. These women groups are being supported by the government through financial institutions that offer them loans, subsidies, and grants, to help them start their own businesses.\n\nShri Lobsang Tsering, Addl. DC, Tawang, the chief guest for the event, stated that the empowerment of women can only be achieved if they are helped in becoming financially independent. Thus, to achieve this goal, the government has been continuously working to support women through a number of welfare schemes.\n\nHe added that local women are being encouraged to explore a variety of options, such as preparing pickles, as well as crafting traditional dresses and other utilitarian items, using locally available resources. This will help them to become financially strong, while also eliminating the need to resort to markets outside the state. He concluded his address, asking women participants of the programme to leverage this training to enhance their skillsets, and also encouraged them to ask questions to the resource personnel, to clarify any doubts that might remain, during the technical session.",

    "post_content": "A comprehensive study was recently published by Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship (GAME), on entrepreneurship opportunities for women in India, especially home-based entrepreneurs across urban India. GAME, a partner-led platform which works to supports mass entrepreneurship, conducted its research during May to August 2019, across Bengaluru and Mumbai.\n\nTitled ‘Unlocking Entrepreneurship Opportunities for Women’, the study showed that only three per cent of businesses having more than four employees in India, are currently women-owned. It showed that food, education, and the beauty and wellness sector possess the highest potential for home-based women entrepreneurs. In addition, the study also evaluated the demands, megatrends, and challenges that budding women entrepreneurs in India face, today.\n\nThe education sector had significantly more women-owned businesses, than the food sector, with one out of five urban enterprises in the education sector being owned by a woman. These businesses were also found to be largely gender-balanced, with women making up roughly 48 per cent of the employee strength at these organisations. On the other hand, day care and pre-school, vocational skilling, and after-school education, were presented as the three sectors possessing the highest potential for entrepreneurship opportunities.\n\nIn retrospect, the food sector consists of close to 5,50,000 women-led businesses, which employ over two million women. The study stated that the sector appealed more to women since it does not require a high initial investment, while also offering flexible work schedules. As per the report, emerging opportunities in the sector included homemade snacks, home-cooked meals, and cloud kitchens.\n\nThe study also highlighted the roadblocks that women entrepreneurs in the country face, such as the lack of awareness regarding the existing entrepreneurial possibilities in their field or passion, lack of adequate skills or knowledge on how to become a successful entrepreneur, fear of taking unconventional paths, along with severely limited accessibility to resources and support systems.\n\nIn light of this, the study also presented a number of remedial steps that can be taken to boost women entrepreneurship in the country. These include encouraging and supporting the growth of peer-to-peer connections and learning among entrepreneurs, along with spreading awareness about the success stories of entrepreneurs, providing access to better entrepreneurship curriculum, and encouraging them to utilise government benefits, such as Mudra loans and more.",

    "post_content": "A conference for women entrepreneurs was held on December 14<sup>th<\/sup> in Madhya Pradesh, with the theme, ‘<strong>Women in Business<\/strong>: <strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">#Bringing Change<\/span><\/strong>’. The conference was organised by the Indian Women Network (IWN) chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII-IWN).\n\nThe conference was aimed at helping women entrepreneurs in the state reinvent and revaluate their vision and goals, in order to better leverage the entrepreneurial opportunities in the industry. The conference included an inaugural session, along with two plenary sessions, on <span style=\"color: #000000;\">“Identifying Future Opportunities # Changing Workplace Dynamics”, and “Changing Perception # Creating Social Impact”.<\/span>\n\nThe Keynote Speaker of the conclave was Amrita Rai, the Managing Editor of Swaraj Express TV and Hindkisan.com. During her address, she highlighted the urgent need for large scale women-centric change in the society, for the development of the nation. She said, “For a country’s economy to progress further, the whole society needs to encourage women entrepreneurs across all spectrums of life.” She also emphasised the need for more women to be involved in the 3 ‘Ps’ in the country, namely, Politics, Police, and Prashashan (Administration).\n\nSufiyah Faruqi Wali IAS, the Managing Director of Madhya Pradesh Seeds and Farm Development Corporation, was present at the conclave as the special guest for the event. She echoed Amrita Rai’s views, stressing the need to change society’s perception towards the business potential and capabilities of working women. She added that even till date, businesses by women tend to be seen as a hobby, instead of their primary pursuit, which needs to change at the earliest. She also called on private organisations to work towards enhancing gender diversity across all verticals and departments, in order to enable faster growth and development.\n\nSonal Shrivastava, the Chairwoman of CII Indian Women Network- Madhya Pradesh, and the Director of Netlink Software Pvt Ltd., further highlighted the crucial role that women empowerment plays in the betterment of society.

    "post_content": "The two-day long Progressive Punjab Investors Summit-2019 reached its conclusion on Friday, with a bright future for the state’s industrial sector. The state government announced that it would take several steps to strengthen and empower entrepreneurship, especially for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).\n\nAmong the key takeaways from the summit was Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s announcement that a Rs 100-crore startup fund would be established to promote innovative enterprises. In addition to that, he also constituted a working group chaired by the Chief Secretary, that would ensure quick execution and delivery of all proposals presented at the summit. A report detailing the same is also to be submitted by the working group, within a month.\n\nInvestors were also promised that the state government would introduce a number of industry-friendly policies, which would help enhance the business capabilities of Punjab’s MSMEs. In light of the many challenges that MSMEs face in gaining access to the market, the Chief Minister also announced the formation of a dedicated MSME marketing cell.\n\nThe Rs 100-crore startup fund would be utilised to further enhance the MSME sector and revitalise the entrepreneurial culture in Punjab. The fund will be created by the state government in partnership with IKG Punjab Technical University, to promote startup incubators. Furthermore, Venture Capitalists and Angel Networks, such as the Indian Angel Network and Bharat Fund, are also expected to contribute to this fund.\n\nAddressing industry concerns about resistance from regulatory bodies for environment and pollution, the Chief Minister announced “Auto Consent to the Green Category Industry on Intimation”. This will allow the state government to eliminate the need for inspection by any regulatory body, with approvals being provided on the same day of the intimation. As a result, this will promote budding entrepreneurs to set up new initiatives and businesses in the state.",

    "post_content": "According to a study of the Bloomberg data on the gender composition of boards of 91 companies on the BSE-100 index, the median number of women on Indian boards has doubled during the last five years. However, that number is still negligible; two in 2018-19, as compared to one, five years ago. Similarly, women accounted for median 10 per cent of the board at the time, which has increased to only 14 per cent, today.\n\nThis shows that India Inc is still far behind the US in terms of gender diversity on boards. As per the 2018 US Spencer Stuart Board Index, women account for almost one-fourth of the directors of S&amp;P 500 companies, with an average of 2.6 female directors on each board. While two or more women hold the position of directors at 87 per cent of S&amp;P 500 companies, the number is only 54 per cent on Indian boards.\n\nApollo Hospitals possesses the most gender-diversified board on the BSE-100 index, made up of 42 per cent women, ONGC has the least diversified board, with only 6 per cent women. Public sector undertakings (PSUs) continue to be the slowest in improving the diversity of their boards, with four of the top ten BSE-100 companies having the worst diversity ratios at the board level in FY19. The Bajaj group companies, including Bajaj Auto and Bajaj Finance, is also on this list.\n\nDespite the urgent call for global diversity on boards, a number of companies like Tata Global Beverages, Titan, Axis Bank, LIC Housing Finance, and HDFC Bank, have instead, seen an erosion of diversity on their boards, over the last five financial years.\n\nIt appears that almost one-fourth of the BSE-100 companies are only ensuring the presence of a woman director on the board for the sake of the minimum compliance of the Companies Act, 2013. As evidence to this, out of the 91 companies on the index, 24 have consistently had only a single woman director, for the last five years.\n\nHowever, trends show that companies which have the highest gender diversity ratio are currently the market leaders, or feature among the leading players in the Indian industrial landscape. While Apollo Hospitals is the largest private sector hospital chain in India, Godrej Consumer Products is a market leader in household insecticides and the second largest marketer of soaps in the country. Similarly, UltraTech Cement, Cipla, and Infosys, are each market leaders in their corresponding industries.",

    "post_content": "The Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) has launched a new initiative to mentor students from an institute in West Bengal, with the aim of creating a new line of market-ready entrepreneurs. The oldest business institution in India, and one of the oldest in Asia, it signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the University Institute of Technology, Burdwan University, on Saturday, finalising the programme.\n\nAs per the MoU, valid till March 2020, two members of the BCCI will be providing on-campus mentoring to the students of the institute, which is a constituent of the Burdwan University. Through this programme, the institution is renewing its efforts to encourage and support the growing list of budding entrepreneurs in the state with unique industry insights, along with enhanced entrepreneurial knowhow and business acumen.\n\nIn addition to that, the chamber has also launched a Women Entrepreneurship Cell, aimed at encouraging more and more women to take up entrepreneurship, to create sustainable businesses that can offer enhanced social utility.\n\nRajesh Singhal, AVP of Bennett Coleman and Co Ltd, stated at an entrepreneurship summit, “Success of start-ups does not depend on external funding. It is not necessary. One has to make business more sustainable for customers.”\n\nB B Chatterjee, Director, ITC Infotech India Limited, and president of BCCI, said that uncertainty is always a major factor in entrepreneurship, and running a business requires a mix of knowledge and following one's instincts.\n\nPreviously, in October, the business institution had entered into a partnership with US-based consulting firm Frost &amp; Sullivan, to create a research cell for the state. While the funding for the project is to be provided by the US company, BCCI would focus on several sectors like agriculture, MSME, healthcare, and skill development. The Chamber also plans on collaborating with many other premier institutes in West Bengal, along with expanding to several districts in the state, through local branch offices.",

    "post_content": "A new report published by the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) states that women make up 28 per cent of all entrepreneurs in the country. According to the study, this number is also growing rapidly – 3.1 times faster than it is for male entrepreneurs.\n\nIn addition to this, the report further states that the total number of women entrepreneurs in the country has grown four what it was in 1976, when only 11 percent of entrepreneurs in the country were women.\n\n“The Changing Face of Canadian Entrepreneurship”, as the study is called, was published last Tuesday, in celebration of the sixth edition of Women’s Entrepreneurship Day. As per its findings, 2018 saw 44,700 Canadians launch their own businesses, the highest figure recorded by BDC in the last 10 years. Out of this, 39 percent of the entrepreneurs were women.\n\nBDC is a Government operated corporation based in Montreal, aimed at helping “create and develop Canadian businesses through financing, growth, and transition capital, venture capital and advisory services, with a focus on small and medium-sized enterprises.”\n\nOne of the more insightful observations found in the study was that women entrepreneurs are not very motivated by monetary goals. In fact, as much as 64 percent of women surveyed stated that their goal was, instead, to someday become their own boss. On the other hand, 59 percent of them stated that they set up their business ventures in order to pursue their passion, while, 30 percent of the respondents said that they were driven by their desire to create a positive impact on the society.\n\nLaura Didyk, vice-president and national lead of women entrepreneurs for BDC, said, “Entrepreneurship is on the rise and women are driving most of that activity.”\n\nHaving made a promise in 2018 to lend $1.4 billion to women-driven businesses by 2021, BDC stated that the corporation has already doubled the number of women entrepreneurs it finances, over the duration of the last three years.\n\nThe Crown Corporation also referenced a new study published by the Boston Consulting Group which had projected that an equal number of women and men entrepreneurs would help grow the world GDP by $5 trillion, and Canada’s GDP by $80 billion.",

    "post_content": "In today’s highly competitive entrepreneurial market, the gender disbalance is still starkly evident. While more and more women are stepping out of their professional journeys and stepping into a business venture, the success and support they find remains highly disproportionate. A new finding suggests that owing to the skewed dynamics of perception, this can, in part, be attributed to women entrepreneurs’ struggles with ‘bragging.’\n\nSelf-Promotion Gap was a study of women’s fears of self-promotion, commissioned by Mighty Forces, Southpaw Insights, Upstream Analysis, and Grey Horse Communications. Following the sixth edition of Women’s Entrepreneurship Day, it showed that as much as 69% of women downplay or avoid talking about their achievements, despite a majority of them (83%) being inspired by those of other women.\n\nThis gap seems to grow even wider with age, with older women being 20% more likely to attempt to blend in with others, than highlight their strengths and successes. This is particularly worrisome, as it indicates that experienced women, who have advanced greatly in their careers, and possibly have countless achievements, are least likely to want to discuss them.\n\nIn the field of entrepreneurship, this can be a death knell for women, as most early-stage investors make their decisions based on the founder, rather than the idea or the product. Hence, the more flamboyant and impressive a founder is, the higher their chances to secure more funding. As a result, most male-owned businesses continue to receive 23 times more VC funding than the national average, despite 1.5 times more women-led businesses being established today.\n\nHowever, the silver lining to this is that the trend is gradually starting to shift, especially when it comes to younger women, in the bracket of 18-34 years of age. The survey states that these women are 34% more likely to be comfortable speaking about their achievements and wanting to stand out, as compared to older women (17%).\n\nResearch also shows that both men and women enjoy hearing women speak about their achievements, with 57% of men older than 55 years of age being inspired by women who stand up for themselves. The same is true for 47% of older women, 42% of younger men, and 41% of younger women.\n\nThis presents a comparatively brighter future for the latest generation of women entrepreneurs, who are gradually but steadily rising above the set standards and reclaiming their space in the global business world.",

    "post_content": "India saw a marginal rise in regular wage earners and salaried employees in its urban workforce between April-June 2018 and January-March 2019, from 48.3% to 50%, as per the latest Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) by the National Statistical Organisation (NSO). The report, published on Saturday, showed women performing better than men, a trend that has been consistent throughout the last four quarters. While there has been a 2.1 percent increase in female salaried workers in organised sectors, the number of male workers has grown by 1.5 percent.\n\nHowever, more than one-fifth of young professionals looking for jobs in Indian cities were unable to secure employment during the last quarter of 2018-19. The survey considered the period of January-March 2019, during which, there was a 22.5% unemployment rate among individuals in the 15 to 29 years age bracket.\n\nWhile this rate was the lowest among the four quarters covered by the survey, it also highlights an urgent need for unemployment issues in the Indian labour market to be addressed. The labour participation rate had fallen to 36% during January-March 2019, the lowest in three quarters. The statistic was even worse for women, with only 15% seeking work or in employment, as compared to men (56.2%). This slowdown was significantly stronger in the 15-29 years bracket.\n\nA gender-based study of the report shows that the unemployment rate for women seeking jobs was considerably higher. During the fourth quarter, the unemployment rate for women was 29%, 8 points higher than that of men, despite women constituting a smaller part of the total labour force.\n\nOn the other hand, the proportion of self-employed individuals also fell, from 38.9% in April-June 2018 to 37.7% in the latest survey period. The study further indicated a decrease in the share of the agriculture sector and secondary sectors like mining, manufacturing, and construction, while that of the tertiary sector, consisting of services, increased.",

    "post_content": "Vanita Salunkhe has been running her cloth bag manufacturing unit in Degaon village in Satara for almost eight years. This year, she completed the one-year ‘Deshi MBA’ programme run by the Mann Deshi Foundation, that works to empower rural women. Equipped with the new skills she learned, she now plans to expand her business further, to provide employment to 1,000 women, by 2022.\n\nThis Saturday, she received her certificate at the annual festival of the foundation, along with 18 other women ‘graduates’, who were mostly school dropouts, with formal education only up to the 8<sup>th<\/sup> or 9<sup>th<\/sup> grade. The ceremony also showcased countless products of entrepreneurial ventures by the rural women in Satara, along with the school bags, shopping bags, and more, manufactured by Salunkhe.\n\nDeshi MBA is a mentorship programme that not only helps rural women entrepreneurs learn the skills required to run a business, but also sustain its expansion and growth. As such, it provides extensive training in financial management and business development, besides connecting them with several marketing platforms, as well.\n\nThe programme operates 13 business schools for rural women in areas like Satara, Pune, Chiplun, Nashik, Latur, and Sinnar. In addition, it also operates nine mobile school vans, a few of which are also equipped with ATMs to encourage their digital literacy.\n\nVanita Shinde, chief administrative officer of Mann Deshi Foundation, said, “We help them with marketing, banking, printing pamphlets and visiting cards, corporate partnerships where they can market their products and we also have a tracking system whereby we know the progress of all the women entrepreneurs undergoing our programme.”\n\nRenuka Ghorpade from Koregaon taluka of Satara and Jaywanti Bhoye of the tribal Peth taluka in Nashik, were also recipients of the certificate. While Ghorpade had begun her business selling lassi on a handcart, she today has a rented space of her own, where she sells pani puri, almond shakes, and many more snacks.\n\nBhoye, on the other hand, had started and selling ‘Nirgudi Oil’, a medicinal massage oil made using wild-growing herbs found in the forests near her village of Bhoipada. However, she had no idea how to properly run her business, with no knowledge of where to buy the bottles from, or how to make the labels. Today, Bhoye is the president of the Mahalaxmi Self-Help Group, and along with its secretary, her business partner, she not only runs her business smoothly, but also grows the medicinal herbs on their own land, owing to the massive increase in demand for her product.\n\nShe said, “The ability to get loans has helped us change our lifestyle. We hope that expanding the business further will bring in more change in our region.”",

    "post_content": "Women employees of the Kolhapur Municipal Transport (KMT) in Maharashtra will now be allowed flexible working hours after it came to light that women ticket collectors were uncomfortable with duty hours ending late at night.\n\nThis comes after civic panel chief Sharangdhar Deshmukh received anonymous complaints, according to a Times of India report. Importantly, most of the women employed in the KMT come from rural areas.\n\nDeshmukh pointed out that a number of women employees have young children and aged parents or in-laws to look after. He said that the transport officials have assured that duty hours will be fixed according to the convenience of the women employees.\n\nThe gender disparity in the transport department has been bridged after women were employed as ticket collectors. But a number of them are assigned to buses plying on long routes. There have been calls to deploy women on shorter routes. Transport officials have also assured that the women will be put on routes that connect their homes so that they can answer domestic emergencies if and when required.\n\nDeshmukh indicated that there are plans to employ more women in the KMT and start special buses for women.",

    "post_content": "The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has taken a big step for the empowerment of underprivileged women by allowing them to operate pay and park facilities in several locations of the city.\n\nAccording to a report in the news agency ANI, a self-group called Sakhi Sangh is involved in the initiative and women from the group operate the pay and park facilities, handing over parking tickets to vehicle owners and earning money in return. The money helps the women to meet their needs.\n\nIndra, one of the women managing the pay and park facilities, said that she is able to support her family with the money earned. She revealed that she has now been able to pay for her son's education and has also been saving for her daughter's wedding.\n\nThe initiative has proved to be a significant stimulus for the empowerment of the women of Sakhi Sangh. It is also a fine advertisement of a simple, yet innovative government measure that can go a long way in empowering women.",

    "post_content": "More and more startups in the Indian entrepreneurial market are today prioritising gender diversity in leadership roles by addressing the many challenges they face and helping manage them. Riddhi Nagpal, director of customer relations at CashKaro, has lunch with co-founder Swati Bhargava once every week to understand and highlight issues at the workplace.\n\nSeveral other new-age companies like Jombay, Uber, Healthians, Bigbasket, Byju’s, and more, are also actively encouraging and supporting future women leaders to nurture their potential to drive growth, product innovation, and profitability.\n\nIn addition, several sensitisation workshops are also being organised to help women combat workplace bias with the help of enhanced career opportunities and more active participation in board meetings.\n\nIndustry experts state that one of the biggest challenges faced by women entrepreneurs is the long and erratic working hours at startups, which most family members cannot cope with. Murali Talasila, partner and innovation leader at PwC India, had said that while efforts are being made, a lot more needs to be done to encourage women entrepreneurs, today. “There is no dearth of talent — it’s just that we need a focused effort,” he said.\n\nCo-founder of Jombay Mohit Gundecha also said that prospective women leaders in the organisation are increasingly involved in product innovation and encouraged to be a part of board meetings and present their findings there. He said, “Access to board members generally is restricted to the top leadership team of an organisation and we have democratised access to them for budding women leaders — it improves their big-picture thinking and executive presence.”\n\nUber, on the other hand, organises 6-12 months-long engagement programmes where the company’s leaders hold discussions and conducts action planning for junior-level female employees. Vishpala Reddy, Uber’s regional HR director - APAC, says that the programme has been proven to help facilitate career growth for women and other underrepresented members of their teams.\n\nDeepak Sahni, founder of Healthians, said that women comprise four of the nine leadership roles in the organisation. The company has also set up an entrepreneur-in-residence drive for potential entrepreneurs, to help them lead new projects as business units, with women making up half of the staff hired, she added.",

    "post_content": "The Karnataka government announced on November 20, 2019, that women who are willing may be employed on the graveyard shift. This indicates a change in the mentality of the government, which was hesitant to allow women to work in office through the night, citing concerns of safety and exploitation.\n\nThe state government said in a notification that it \"hereby allows employment of women workers, who come forward to work during night shifts, between 7 pm to 6 am in the factories registered under the Factories Act 1948\", according to a Live Mint report.\n\nHowever, this relaxation of the rule comes with a few riders. These include adequate measures to prevent and address sexual harassment, provide appropriate working conditions, equal opportunity devoid of discrimination, and other rules to ensure that the safety and sanctity of women employees are not compromised.\n\n\"The employers shall see that the women workers are employed in a batch of not less than 10 and the total (number) of the women workers employed in a night shift shall not be less than 2\/3rd of the total strength,\" according to the notification. The government makes it mandatory to provide sufficient women security staff, restrooms and transport facilities for the benefit of women employees who would be working at night.\n\nKarnataka okaying women working in graveyard shifts assumes significance considering that the government has been trying to improve the ease of doing business in the state, update itself to suit the requirements of new-age companies like start-ups and aggregators that will help both the industry and protect workers from arbitrary rules.",

    "post_content": "Women are breaking into male bastions everywhere, and now the Indian Navy is set to get its first woman pilot.\n\nAccording to a report in The Hindu, Sub Lieutenant Shivangi will earn her 'wings' on December 2, 2019, marking an inspiring journey from a Bihar mofussil to the cockpit of the Indian &nbsp;Navy frontline aircraft.\n\nSub Lt. Shivangi was first attracted to flying as a 10-year-old at the sight of a helicopter carrying a minister. She graduated in mechanical engineering from the Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology. Her interest in flying was whetted by a naval presentation made as part of the university entry scheme. She cleared the Service Selection Board (SSB) examination but had to miss out due to the lack of vacancies. In 2018, she cleared the SSB examination again and this time was recruited. She attended the 6-month-long Naval Orientation Course at the Indian Naval Academy at Ezhimala, and another 6 months flying the Pilatus basic trainer at the Air Force Academy.\n\nSub Lt. Shivangi learned to fly the Dornier maritime reconnaissance aircraft the Kochi-based Indian Naval Air Squadron 550, known as ‘Flying Fish’, the alma mater of naval aviation in India.\n\nSub Lt. Shivangi has logged around 100 hours of flying so far, with over 60 hours on the Dornier as part of the course. She will be put through another six months of mission-based flying in which she will learn to exploit the aircraft for its operational use. The bigger target, however, is to qualify for operating the P8I long-range maritime recce aircraft.\n\nBy the end of December, two more women pilots of the Navy -- Sub Lt. Shubhangi and Sub Lt. Divya -- will get their wings and join Sub Lt. Shivangi and three other officers for the Dornier Operational Flight Training.",

    "post_content": "In India, 'naani ke gharelu nuskhe' is an expression that most people are acquainted with. From solutions to common ailments to beauty secrets, home remedies handed down by mothers and grandmothers are treasure troves. All of us would have some story or the other to share on such 'gharelu nuskhe', but taking them to the market to monetising them needs an entrepreneurial spirit of a different kind.\n\nThis is where Roshni Mehta and her mother Mona stand out. They have seen from close quarters their grandmother taking \"honest, disciplined care of her body\", and it is this 85-year-old lady who inspired the mother-daughter duo to come up with an all-natural self-care line, Yourstory.com reports. Roshni says that even at this age, her grandmother plants her own herbs and flowers and creates her own personal care products. This is like a whiff of fresh air in the age of quick fixes and chemicals from FMCG brands that are not always kind on the skin.\n\nRoshni narrates her first-hand experience of the benefits of the hair oil made by her grandmother. It helped her hair get back the glow that it had started to lose. That is when she came up with the idea of spreading it and other products from her naani to the rest of the world and also earn a few rupees in the process.\n\nThis Hibiscus Monkey -- a \"new-age millennial self-care brand\" -- was born. The products have been curated from all-natural and chemical-free ingredients derived from the knowledge passed down by naani. The targets the millennial women between the ages of 22 and 35 across India, and works on a D2C model, which involves products being sold online through Insta-shop and Facebook.\n\nThe 25-year-old Roshni took the help of her mother, Mona -- a former consultant and corporate banker. The young entrepreneur advises women to embrace self-care and be \"absolutely shameless\" about it rather than simply putting others ahead of themselves as has been expected by the traditional Indian society.\n\nThe products offered by Hibiscus Monkey are free from chemicals, parabens, mineral oils, artificial colour, or fragrance. Manufacturing is outsourced, though the packaging is done in a family-owned unit.\n\nThe hair oil is one of the best-selling products of the company and the founders have made it a point that it is packaged in glass bottles. Roshni says that a millennial brand can't be said to possess a soul if it is not mindful of the environment. They have faced problems for this stance, with shipping companies often refusing to transport Hibiscus Monkey products. There are daily challenges associated with glass-based packaging. But the founders have stuck to their decision and ensured that all packaging is reusable and single-use plastic is avoided totally. Such environment-friendly manufacturing is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call to banish single-use plastic from the country. The mother-daughter duo deserves added credit for that.\n\nThe venture has been growing steadily and has a band of loyal cosumers called the #HMTribe. They not only put up stories and reviews about Hibiscus Monkey on social media, but also take initiatives to make them popular among their family, friends and acquaintances. They have propelled the brand forward in a long way.\n\nThe founders are now planning big. They would soon be launching a series of self-care products, and set up their own manufacturing unit in Kerala, which is home to a number of ingredients that the brand uses. The founders want to give back to society as well. They are keen to adopt a village and sustainably source ingredients from local farmers.\n\nAn 85-year-old woman provided an idea, a woman in her twenties latched on to it and another made it big and her mother supported her all the way. Hibiscus Monkey is a story of woman entrepreneurship and empowerment at its very best.",

    "post_content": "Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) has partnered with Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Kozhikode, to launch ‘La Eve’ – a women entrepreneurship development programme. Meaning ‘The Woman’, the programme aims to identify and support innovative women-led startups in the country.\n\nRudolph Joyer Noronha, General Manager of MRPL, stated that the organisation has joined hands with the institute to promote India’s promising women entrepreneurs, in keeping with the ‘Start-Up India’ mission of the Government. The initiative, he added, is aimed at encouraging Indian women to pursue more business ideas, foraying into a variety of fields, and help them establish a successful venture.\n\nThe programme would be spearheaded by IIMK LIVE (Laboratory for Innovation, Venturing, and Entrepreneurship), the technology business incubator and entrepreneurship development center of the institute, with funding from MRPL. In 2019, MRPL had entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the institute, and has, since, provided seed funding to more than 11 startups incubated at IIMK LIVE.\n\nThe start-ups which will be a part of the programme will be selected on the basis of the projected business model. Among early stage start-ups, only those which have a minimum viable product, or at least a proof of concept, would be eligible.\n\nA seed money of Rs 25 lakh will be provided by MRPL to 11 start-up ideas, as part of the initiative. On the other hand, IIM-Kozhikode will be responsible for providing training and mentorship, and supporting them during their incubation stage, to help them gain success in the industry.\n\nMr Norhonha also added that the deadline for sending applications for the programme would be November 25. Women entrepreneurs would be able to apply for the programme via the ‘Start Up’ section on the MRPL website, or the IIMKLIVE website.",

    "post_content": "India’s tech-savvy women entrepreneurs have today revolutionised multitasking – from coding and solo travelling to engaging in adventure sports, managing their business ventures, and being vocal about relationships and sexuality. Breaking barriers and shattering taboos every day, these individuals are fearless and empowered, which has particularly helped redefine the country’s dating scene.\n\nWhile sex has always been a taboo in India, these individuals are rapidly changing the game today. A recent survey states that 80% of Indians between 18 and 34 years of age, from seven cities, believe that sex is an important part of a relationship. 80% of them also stressed the significance of experimentation and exploration in their sex lives. Women entrepreneurs constituted a majority of the respondents, showcasing the wave of progressive change that the sector is currently undergoing.\n\nTechnological proficiency has played a massive role in this, especially when it comes to dating apps. In fact, a notable (chosen to remain anonymous) founder of an EdTech startup stated that Tinder was life-changing for her. The popular dating app had helped her find the person who would eventually be her founding partner in her business venture.\n\nLaunched in India in 2016, Tinder has picked up rapidly in the next few years. In 2018, it recorded 7.5 Mn daily swipes in India, with Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Gurugram being among its 10 most popular markets, globally. Several other apps have also followed suit since Tinder’s launch, including Grindr, Bumble, Hinge, and OkCupid, along with homegrown apps like Woo and TrulyMadly. New York-based OkCupid today has over one million users in India, recording as many as 25,000 dates, every week.\n\nHowever, the huge population of the country often makes finding the right match an extremely tedious task. This is where tech has helped streamline the process, with many women entrepreneurs using these apps the same way as they would use a project management tool. From scheduling a time during a specific day of the week to spend on the app to using calendar invites to manage both their professional and romantic lives, these women expertly leverage the power of software to organise their entire lives.\n\nIn fact, they aren’t afraid to mix business with pleasure either, often encountering a future business partner or investor on a dating app. Most of these apps use advanced machine learning-based algorithms to match people with similar ideologies, beliefs, and ambitions. As such, they help connect them to other individuals who share extremely similar interests.\n\nSafety on these apps, however, continues to be a concern for these women entrepreneurs, as such apps are also populated by many fraudulent and disconcerting members, most of whom happen to be men. These women don’t let that stop them, however. As Melissa Hobley, the CMO of OkCupid says, “Instead of being told what to do, or having other people choose on their behalf, today’s young Indians — particularly financially independent women — want to make their own choices based on the connection they share with a person.”\n\nThey know exactly how to leverage their potential without compromising on their choices, thereby leading the way for a better future.",

    "post_content": "At a recent United Nations (UN) General Assembly session, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said, “I cannot accept a world that tells my granddaughters that gender equality must wait for their granddaughters’ granddaughters.”\n\nThe truth to this is blaring – when it comes to senior leadership roles, women still constitute the minority, globally. In the Indian corporate world, only 6% of chairpersons are women. Based on this, it is estimated that it will take at least 108 years to bridge the gender gap, and 202 years to have legitimate workplace equality.\n\nA recent Yale University study showed that a group of scientists inherently scored male candidates higher, when asked to review identical job applications from male and female students. Evidentially, India would be 27% richer if it succeeded in rebalancing its workforce, according to The Economist. In fact, a market study by Catalyst also showed that Fortune 500 companies with women on their boards also gained 53% higher returns on equity, 42 percent higher sales, and an almost 66.7% greater ROI than those with only male board members.\n\nBy now, it is well established that women possess better listening skills than men, which will be extremely important for the jobs of the future, along with improved communication, interpretation, and problem-solving skills. A recent study on a demographic of 15-year-old students by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) also showed women possessing much better problem-solving skills than men, in each of the 52 countries surveyed. Thus, this highlights the particularly key role that women professionals will play in the corporate world, in the years to come.\n\nHowever, going forward, true inclusivity will take much more than just HR policies; it will need comprehensive participation and conscious investment from all levels of an organisation. Until subconscious bias is addressed through conscientious self-reflection, organisations will continue to lose out on the immense potential that a diversified workforce offers. Instead of obsessing over how female professionals are different from their male counterparts, the corporate world must embrace their differences. Only then will they move beyond just compliance, and achieve true inclusivity, and with it, gain access to the countless unique strengths and business acumen that women offer.",

    "post_content": "To make it easier for female entrepreneurs to get investment, HSBC Private Banking has entered into a partnership with AllBright, an exclusive women’s membership club in Hong Kong.\n\nThe two companies came together to host a pop-up expo for female entrepreneurs in the Chinese industrial hub. The event had pitch courses, investor workshops, and a Pitch Day. By leveraging the industry experience, insights, and comprehensive global connections of HSBC, the event was designed to help women entrepreneurs gain practical knowledge and guidance in their business ventures. They could meet many highly experienced investors who could provide them with the resources and opportunities to develop their ventures.\n\nThe event featured seven highly promising female entrepreneurs who had established their companies in Hong Kong and helped train them in the skills, connections, and confidence for Hong Kong’s very competitive entrepreneurial environment. The entrepreneurs were also given the opportunity to pitch their business ventures to angel investors, high-networth individuals (HNIs) and influential business leaders.\n\nAccording to ‘<em>She’s the Business’<\/em> report by HSBC Private Banking, Hong Kong has the highest proportion of gender-balanced investor panels, in comparison to other markets, at 81 percent of all panels. However, the report showed 31 percent of female entrepreneurs in Hong Kong still experienced gender bias while trying to raise money.\n\nThe banking giant is working on understanding the many barriers that women face in their business journeys. In 2019, HSBC also became a founding partner of The WealthiHer Network launched by entrepreneur Tamara Gillan of Cherry London, an enterprise dedicated to diversifying women’s wealth to better service female investors and create a stronger business impact in their ventures.",

    "post_content": "To encourage Indian women entrepreneurs, new-age fintech startup Aye Finance raised Rs 125 crore on Wednesday from Dutch entrepreneurial development bank FMO by issuing non-convertible debentures. The Gurgaon-based company specialises in providing loans to small and medium business enterprises in India and this fundraising venture is expected to help expand its credit providing capabilities for enterprises led by women entrepreneurs.\n\nThe fundraising was driven and executed by Northern Arc Capital, a Chennai-based NBFC which had invested in Aye Finance, in January 2019. Previously, CapitalG, the growth equity investment fund of Alphabet Inc, Google's parent company, had invested a sum of INR 115 crore in Aye Finance in 2018-19. With the funds from FMO, this brings its total funding to over INR 2,200 crore. According to Linda Broekhuizen, Chief Investment Officer at FMO, Aye Finance will on-lend the debentures issued by it to micro entrepreneurs, half of whom will be women entrepreneurs in the area of underbanked clients.\n\nThe sixth Economic Census published by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation in 2018 stated that men still constitute 86 percent of Indian entrepreneurship. As a result, women entrepreneurs in India continue to face an uphill climb, with many venture capitalists remaining apprehensive about investing in a woman-led business. This was also evidenced by Sanjay Sharma, MD and Founder of Aye Finance, who stated that women co-applicants constituted the recipients of over 95 percent of the loans provided by the company.\n\nHence, the deal with FMO will help Aye Finance set up a gender finance programme that enables women-driven micro enterprises in India to bring about a more impactful transformation of the economy. To this end, the company had added the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Gujarat, and Maharashtra to its branch network this year, owing to the prevalence of women entrepreneurs in such regions. The funds from FMO will not only help it support the growth of women-led enterprises in these states, but also in 14 other states where it already has an established presence.",

    "post_content": "Do not flaunt your body because sexuality scrambles the mind. Speak briefly as women often ramble and miss the point. Do not confront men in meetings in order to not threaten him but to rather talk to him in private. When having a conversation with a man, cross your legs and sit at an angle to him. Do not talk face-to-face to men as it threatens them. Maintain a 'good haircut' and only wear clothes that complement the body.\n\nAccording to reports in HuffPost and News18, these are some of the terribly misogynistic instructions provided to around 30 women employees by Ernst &amp; Young during a training programme called Power-Presence-Purpose (PPP) at its office in Hoboken, New Jersey, in June 2018.\n\nAnd there is more.\n\nThe training programme also claimed that women's brains are 6-11% smaller than those of men. It said that \"women’s brains absorb information like pancakes soak up syrup, so it’s hard for them to focus\". However, male brains were more like waffles that were \"better able to focus because the information collects in each little waffle square\".\n\nAnd there is still more.\n\nThe women employees were also reportedly asked to fill out a questionnaire of so-called masculine and feminine traits. While the former included traits like 'acting like a leader', being 'aggressive', 'self-reliant', 'competitive', 'athletic', and 'dominant', the latter included traits like being 'cheerful', 'child-like', 'affectionate', 'shy', and 'eager to soothe hurt feelings' among others. Interestingly, in what can be considered the height of misogyny, 'femininity' was also a trait listed under the section on 'feminine characteristics'.\n\nThe women had to score themselves on each of the traits to see how feminine or masculine they were. These questionable and downright offensive techniques were devised to fit women into a space dominated by men. The training was imparted in the form of a 55-page presentation during a seminar on leadership and empowerment. It took place in the aftermath of the Me Too movement. Ernst &amp; Young wasn't untouched by the Me Too movement and had to fire an employee for sexual misconduct. The force of the Me Too movement compelled large organisations like E&amp;Y to overhaul their sexual harassment policies and training.\n\nThe contents of the programme created massive outrage on social media with many terming them as 'rage-inducing' and 'sick'.\n\nWhen contacted, E&amp;Y said that the PPP course is under review and the June workshop was the last time that version of training was held. The course “is no longer offered in its current form”, the company said.\n\nNotably, only 20.4% of the principals and partners of E&amp;Y are women while only 12% are employed as client service partners with the firm.",

    "post_content": "Women with highly stressful work lives are 40% more prone to heart diseases than those who are less stressed-out, according to a Harvard University study.\n\nThe study, which analysed the work lives of 17,000 female medical professionals, observed that the women who live with the fear of expulsion from their jobs are more prone to high cholesterol levels, hypertension and obesity, according to a report in The New Indian Express.\n\nThe human body is built in a way that naturally responds to life-threatening situations. The brain sets off a cascade of hormones and chemicals that speeds up heart rate and breathing, elevates blood pressure and boosts the glycogen supply to the muscles. However, the body is not very good at differentiating between imminent dangers and less pronounced instances of ongoing stress related to problems in the office, financial difficulties, or anxiety about adversities that haven’t occurred yet.\n\nStress triggers inflammation, which causes the narrowing of coronary arteries, thereby increasing the possibilities of a heart attack. Constant stress also makes it difficult to maintain healthy habits, like following a good diet, getting sufficient exercise, abstaining from smoking, and getting enough sleep.\n\nJuggling concurrent jobs like caring for aging parents and children and taking greater pains in running the household, taking care of the office at the same time, is also a source of stress for working women.\n\nThe best tool to combat stress that can be adopted easily in our day-to-day lives is yoga. It synchronises our body and mind and is a powerful means to relax the mind. Yoga can help to prevent spasms in blood vessels by controlling stress and bringing down blood pressure.\n\nVarious yogic kriyas and asanas help to remove toxins and acidic substances from the blood. They improve blood circulation, strengthen the cardiovascular system, reduce depression and anxiety, and improve the quality of sleep.\n\nDeep breathing exercises, meditation, walking and cycling, and indulging in relaxing hobbies such as gardening or painting also go a long way in reducing daily stress.\n\nLast but not the least, a diet that consists of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, lentils, natural sugars as well as herbs like kava root, lemon balm, lavender, and chamomile can help to relieve anxiety, sleeplessness, restlessness, and other stress-related symptoms. Similarly, cinnamon, garlic, turmeric, ginger, basil, and black seed provide vital support for the body to fight inflammation and oxidative stress.",

    "post_content": "Thousands of women in Japan have spoken out against the unfriendly workplace policy that makes it mandatory for them to wear high heels to the office.\n\nAccording to a report in BBC, at the forefront of the campaign is Japanese writer and actress Yumi Ishikawa, who started a petition calling for an end to dress codes after she was made to wear high heels while working at a funeral parlour.\n\nIshikawa points out that the emphasis on high heels is ingrained in the culture and has become a social norm in Japan. Women wearing flat shoes like men are considered to possess bad manners and they are looked down upon, Ishikawa reveals and hopes that her campaign will help to change this social norm.\n\nAround 19,000 people have already signed Ishikawa's petition and her tweets on the issue have gone viral with more than 30,000 shares.\n\nThe campaign, referred to as <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">#KuToo<\/span> in Japan, plays on the Japanese words 'kutsu' (shoes) and 'kutsuu' (pain) and references the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment in the workplace. The campaigners have pointed out that women job applicants need to be amenable to wearing high heels to the office for being eligible for the jobs. Refusal to conform to this norm results in disciplinary action.\n\nThis is not the only dress code issue that working women in Japan have raised their voices against in recent times. According to another BBC report, some companies in Japan had banned women employees from wearing glasses at work, drawing considerable flak on social and mainstream media.\n\nAlso, Japan is not the only country that has expressed discomfort with dress codes for women in the workplace.\n\nIn 2015, a London receptionist was sent home from work and denied salary for refusing to wear high heels.\n\nNicola Thorp, hired as a temporary staff member at finance company PwC, was asked to wear high heels to the office by her employer. She, however, refused and launched a campaign to change dress codes in the UK.\n\nMedia coverage of this issue has borne fruit with outsourcing firm Portico announcing that female colleagues could \"wear plain flat shoes\" with immediate effect.\n\nIn 2017, a Canadian province scrapped a rule that made it mandatory for women to wear high heels to the office. The government of British Columbia acknowledged the health risks associated with high heels that include physical injury from slipping or falling and possible damage to the feet, legs, and back.\n\nAccording to a report in DailyMail, high heels can result in a host of health issues from lower back pain, pinched nerves and bunions to restricting blood circulation, clawed toes, muscle shortening of calf and hamstring muscles, and sprained or broken ankles.",

For this to happen, Naidu said that the Indian universities and institutes of higher learning must reorient their methods of teaching and put a sharper focus on research. In Indian civilization, the emphasis has always been on a holistic integrated vision of education. We must bring back this multi-disciplinary approach to learning,\" Naidu was quoted as saying.\n\nThe vice president urged universities like JNU to raise the bar.

    "post_content": "American investment bank, Goldman Sachs, earlier this year, relaxed the official dress code for all its employees with the objective of bringing about a more casual environment in the workplace and attract top talent.\n\nAccording to reports in BBC and CNBC, Goldman Sachs announced in an internal memo a \"firm-wide flexible dress code\", but left it on the employees to exercise their good judgment in fashion choices.\n\n\"Casual dress is not appropriate every day and for every interaction and we trust you will consistently exercise good judgment in this regard,\" said the memo.\n\nAccording to the US bank, the move was influenced by the \"changing nature of workplaces generally in favour of a more casual environment\".\n\nGoldman Sachs, historically known as a white-shoe investment bank, had required its employees to wear formal business attire. However, from 2017, Goldman started loosening the dress code for its employees in the technology division and other new digital businesses. Other Wall Street banks have also been trying to secure the best employees. JP Morgan had already taken steps for a more lenient dress code three years ago.\n\nOver three-fourths of Goldman employees are millennials, or members of the so-called Generation Z -- people born after 1981. The memo was signed by top Goldman Sachs executives, including chief executive David Solomon.\n\nGoldman Sachs is one of the world's most powerful investment banks but has faced flak for its role in the global financial and eurozone debt crises.",

    "post_content": "Bizarre and downright oppressive dress code for working women at Japanese offices created a storm on social media, proving that a developed economy may not coincide with a developed and progressive work culture.\n\nAccording to a report in BBC earlier this month, some companies in Japan had banned women employees from wearing glasses at work. Several reasons were given for this draconian rule, most of them being utterly strange. For instance, some retail chains said women shop assistants wearing spectacles gave a \"cold impression\".\n\nMedia outlets like Nippon TV and Business Insider reported on how firms across industries prohibit their women employees from wearing glasses at the workplace. These media outlets also revealed the reasons given by these companies for doing so. Thus, while glasses were considered to be a safety concern in the airline industry, women working in the beauty industry were discouraged from wearing glasses as that was deemed to conceal make-up.\n\nSuch companies may have been driven by a hard-nosed calculation of what they feel works best for their 'brand image', but the glasses ban doesn't exactly qualify them as the most humane and employee-friendly workplaces around.\n\nThe glasses ban attracted a lot of criticism on social media, with the hashtag 'glasses are forbidden' trending.\n\nAccording to Kumiko Nemoto, professor of sociology at Kyoto University of Foreign Studies, people in Japan are reacting to \"outdated\" policies. She said it reflected the \"old, traditional Japanese\" mindset and slammed the blatant gender discrimination.\n\nNemoto pointed out that the glasses ban emanated from the companies' idea of femininity and glasses did not fit in that definition.\n\nJapanese workplaces were at the centre of a similar controversy over dress codes recently, with actor and writer Yumi Ishikawa launching a petition to end dress codes in Japan after being made to wear high heels while working at a funeral parlour.",

However, it has highlighted a very critical point about women entrepreneurs in India. “There are much discussion and debate about how to support female entrepreneurs — and rightly so... The focus is often on improving access to credit (financial capital) or providing training to help women build new skills (human capital) — two areas critical for improving the success of women-led businesses. However, another key factor in the success of these businesses tends to be overlooked: access to networks,” states the report.\n\nIt is necessary to accept that if the society and government (both state and central) can harness the full and true potential of women entrepreneurs, it can be a catalyst in innovation, economic growth, and job creation.\n\n“I am happy that in recent years, we have seen an upward trend in women’s participation in decision making and entrepreneurship but we are yet to witness considerable participation,” was a concern recently raised by the Vice President of India, M. Venkaiah Naidu.\n\nAccording to a reply in Lok Sabha early this year, given by Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), Giriraj Singh, 1.38 lakh projects have been set up by the women entrepreneurs under Prime Minister’s Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) Scheme since inception till January 23, 2019.\n\nThe projects set up by women entrepreneurs are about 30% of total projects set up under PMEGP.\n\nThis is one of the many programs that can help women entrepreneurs financially but, there is a need for a holistic scheme that can also help them grow in a gender-neutral way.",

However, there is still a huge gap that needs to be bridged to boost women entrepreneurship in the country,” said Raman Kalyanakrishnan, Head- Strategy at Tata Trusts.\n\nThis is an attempt to take the women closer to their objective of financial self-sufficiency. The Tata Trust statement claimed that the program was started in 23 villages of Bahraich district where 60 women were trained and nano retail. Training is underway simultaneously in five districts of Uttar Pradesh and 10 districts of Bihar.\n\nMany of the potential women entrepreneurs have been imparted digital literacy skills through the Internet Saathi program in these districts.\n\n“Digital skills not only Impact the economic and social development of the villages but also improves the quality of life and contributes to the nation’s economy,” said Harish Krishnan, Managing Director, Public Affairs and Strategic Engagements, Cisco India &amp; SAARC.\n\nThe program identifies potential women entrepreneurs and offers training on the basics of setting up and operating small enterprises. It will guide women in identifying business ideas and provide help in setting up the business. The identified women undergo five days of training that includes on-ground market research and consolidation of business ideas through a need gap analysis and building core business skills. The women are then guided through to set-up their enterprises.\n\nInitial capital support is also given to the identified entrepreneurs to meet the initial expenses.",

    "post_content": "The growth in women entrepreneurship can help manage the difficulties of unemployment in the society, says a report by PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\nHowever, the report has pointed certain pain points in development of women entrepreneurs in India. It has drawn attention to the fact that in India as compared to other countries, the focus is still in spreading awareness about entrepreneurship. But in other countries the focus has shifted from awareness to participation, which eventually helps in involvement of women in policy related decision making.\n\nUnlike India, other countries have sharply designed their cutting edge polices for women. Thus other countries like China and Singapore have moved a step ahead in commercialization and adding them to total technological asset created by country.\n\n“Even today, India is still struggling with issues of social acceptability, changing mindsets, inequality and irrational judgments which are making the journey of a women entrepreneur more difficult,” states the report.\n\nThe apex industry chamber has suggested a few actions that will help to ensure, a steady growth of women entrepreneurs in India. Among them, that requires immediate action is development of an entrepreneurial ecosystem. It must be set up with a cluster approach in specific sectors and regions. These clusters will further support new ventures to nourish, fund and sustain the dynamic environment.\n\nAnother key, recommendation is: In addition to policies and schemes, there must be mentoring group at multiple levels inIndia, from districts to cities to state to central. These groups can assist the aspiring women entrepreneurs to convert their dreams to reality.\n\n“While many Indian women have ambitions towards entrepreneurship, it is often more difficult for them to succeed. In fact, India has been found to be in a group of countries where women business owners (as well as women leaders and professionals) struggle with less favourable conditions,” says Dr. Sabrina Korreck a Senior Fellow at Observer Research Foundation in her article on ‘Women Entrepreneurs in India.",

    "post_content": "HSBC has gone the extra mile to help its women employees in India by reforming its childcare benefit policy. Last month, it raised the maximum age limit of children who get the support of daycare reimbursement from two to six years. A fixed monthly childcare allowance of Rs 10,000 was also announced for returning mothers who forgo daycare reimbursement.\n\nHSBC said it is the only bank to offer a fixed monthly childcare allowance for returning mothers.\n\nAccording to a report in The Economic Times, daycare expenses on actuals incurred by female employees would be eligible for reimbursement until the child attains the age of six. The amount for the reimbursement has been fixed at up to Rs 18,000 per month in Mumbai, Rs 13,500 per month in the National Capital Region, Bengaluru, and Pune, and up to Rs 10,000 per month in other cities. The benefit can be availed every quarter by the female employees until the child reaches six. If an employee has twins or more than one child under the age of six, she can avail of the benefit for each child.\n\nHR head of HSBC, Vikram Tandon, pointed out that with this policy, the organisation has enhanced its support for women employees so that they can maintain a balance between work life and motherhood. The policy also provides working mothers the freedom to pick the best among various childcare options for an extended period, Tandon added.",

    "post_content": "Sexual harassment in the workplace is turning out to be a growing menace in Germany, with 1 in 11 employees reporting that they were victims of unwanted sexual comments and advances.\n\nThis has been found in a study of 1,531 people by the German Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency, according to a report in <a href=\"http:\/\/dw.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">dw.com<\/a>. A similar study four years ago had revealed that 1 in 14 employees complained of sexual harassment. The rise in the number of sexual harassment cases in the workplace in Germany is a deeply worrying trend.\n\nAccording to the 2019 study, women are twice as likely as men to face sexual harassment in the office. Thus while 5% of male employees said that they were sexually harassed, the corresponding figure for women was 13%. Another disturbing statistic was that 43% of the sexual harassment was perpetrated by work colleagues, with one out of five culprits being seniors. Fifty-three percent of the perpetrators were third party agents, like customers and patients.\n\nNearly four people out of five complained that they were sexually harassed by multiple perpetrators.\n\nThe forms of harassment ranged from sexualised comments and jokes, inappropriate looks or gestures to cat-calling. Questioning of an intimate nature and inappropriate touching or approaches were also common.\n\nSexting, which comprises sending of sexual images and text via social media, emails, and messages were the other ways in which the victims were targeted.\n\nMore severe forms of harassment consisted of invites to private meetings, being asked to engage in sexual acts, and sometimes, coercion or blackmail, the study found.\n\nBernhard Franke, acting head of the anti-discrimination office, noted that sexual harassment at the workplace is a serious problem, which can severely affect the victims. He called for German companies to intervene and devise ways, including obligatory training to managers, to stop this menace.\n\nGermany's labour law puts the responsibility of employers to protect their workers from sexual harassment. However, workers are often fearful of raising a hue and cry thinking of what repercussions that would have on their careers. Thus only 40% of those who have suffered sexual harassment at the workplace had approached third parties for grievance redress.",

    "post_content": "Megha Ahuja would have been shocked when she learned of her mother's ovarian cancer last year. She could have been shattered. But she is a strong woman. She did her research and found that while there still some information on breast and cervical cancer, there is very scanty knowledge of ovarian cancer.\n\nThis led her to launch Sashakt - The Ovarian Cancer Foundation in October 2018. According to a report in <a href=\"http:\/\/yourstory.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YourStory<\/a>, the 32-year-old Ahuja received tremendous support from her family and friends, and the staff and children at her school for the foundation of Sashakt - a non-profit organisation that seeks to make every woman sashakt (empowered) with knowledge and support to fight ovarian cancer. The organisation, based in Delhi, spreads awareness on the disease through workshops, events and social media campaigns.\n\nThe Indian Council for United Nations Relations (ICUNR) recognised Ahuja for her work through Sashakt with the International Women’s Day Award in March this year. She runs Udaan, an afternoon school for girls with special needs, and is the director at Vivekanand School. Ahuja is a TEDx organiser and an author too.\n\nToday Ahuja's mother is on the road to recovery, but she feels that knowledge of the symptoms would have helped in early diagnosis and treatment of her mother's disease. She reveals that the symptoms of ovarian cancer are so subtle that patients often miss them, or opt for no more than home remedies.\n\nSashakt has reached out to women through awareness workshops in schools, colleges, and corporate organisations. It has also reached out to women in slums and rural areas near Gurugram. it has also mobilised the support of Koala Cab drivers, who have helped in distributing awareness posters in Hindi among their communities. The organisation has also collaborated with WorldMark, and Innov8 coworking spaces, and with SHEROES in their health community. Campaigns are also run on Radio Nasha and Ishq FM. Events like the Sashakt Hope Meet and the Sashakt Teal Party have also played a big role in spreading awareness about ovarian cancer.\n\nThe <span style=\"color: #33cccc;\">#AskYourMom<\/span> campaign on social media has been another big initiative of Sashakt. Launched on May 12, it encouraged women to discuss with their mothers and grandmothers about the symptoms of ovarian cancer and visit a doctor if symptoms persist for more than two weeks. It involved noted influencers like Rajeev Khandelwal, Manoj Muntashir, Gaurav Chopra, the Indian women’s cricket team, renowned authors, entrepreneurs, and social activists in the campaign.\n\nAhuja emphasises that cancer is not a death sentence and that the only way to defeat the disease is to accept the reality, embrace the pain and find the courage to move ahead, one day at a time. Through her efforts, she has been able to fill the hearts of numerous people suffering from cancer with hope and has made ready to fight the disease head-on.",

    "post_content": "In another victory over social injustice and gender inequality, Rashika Raj from Tamil Nadu has become the first person in India to be registered as a trans nurse and midwife.\n\nAccording to a News Minute report, the 23-year-old Rishika had completed her nursing course and wanted to be registered under the Tamil Nadu Nurses and Midwives Council (TNNMC) under the 'third gender' category. However, her efforts hit a wall when the TNNMC started to cite procedural complexities. This was in spite of the Supreme Court's 2014 verdict that allowed transgender people to apply for education and employment under the 'third gender' category.\n\nThe nursing council said that an amendment needs to be introduced in the Nursing Council Act for her request to be taken forward. This led Rishika to approach the Madras High Court, which ruled that the nursing council should register Rishika as a 'woman transgender' for the time being before an official government order is passed.\n\nFollowing this, the TNNMC registered Rishika temporarily as a trans woman, and after an amendment to the Nursing Council Act, the 'third gender' category would be included.\n\nDespite this win, however, what becomes evident from this case is the difficulties transgender people still face in the country to get themselves socially recognised as they are. Sadly, this is true notwithstanding legal safeguards in favour of the transgender people. It is only when they approach the courts and acquire a ruling in their favour that they can claim their rights.",

    "post_content": "One of the most unique programmes for the empowerment of women entrepreneurs, All-India Road Show on Women's Economic Empowerment through Entrepreneurship (AIRSWEEE), launched by TiE, has touched the lives of numerous women in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities of India.\n\nIn an interview with Live Mint, Seema Chaturvedi, Chairperson, AIRSWEEE 1.0 and 2.0, said that the programme was launched in 2016 when no many were talking about entrepreneurship as a means of empowering women. The programme started with 125 women, who attended workshops and went through mentoring for six months. In the second year, this method was repeated with an eye on multiplying its effect. In the second year, 450 new women were roped in. This was a quantum jump in the membership of the programme. Thus a total of 575 women from nearly 100 cities and 20 states of the country received hands-on mentoring, revealed Chaturvedi.\n\nIn the third phase, under the AIRSWEEE Global Fellows initiative, women entrepreneurs would travel to the US and shadow CEOs of aligned global companies for 10 days, thereby enriching their hands-on experience.\n\nThe AIRSWEEE programme has not only benefited the women who have received direct mentorship, but it has also had a positive indirect effect on nearly 2,500 women-centric businesses through the pay-it-forward ethos of the AIRSWEEE members.\n\nChaturvedi said that the programme concentrated on Tier 2 and 3 cities because 70-75% of India's population lives there. It was also felt that since women generally invest 80-85% of what they earn in the community, investing in women would be a worthwhile means of economic development.\n\nThe biggest takeaway of the programme, according to Chaturvedi, is that it is a sustainable way to grow women entrepreneurs. It builds a community of women entrepreneurs who can connect and support each other in their darkest hours.\n\nAIRSWEE is funded by the US state department for three consecutive years and has total funding of close to $315 million at present.",

It would be put to practice in Rajasthan, Telangana and the Northeast Region.\n\nProject ‘Her&amp;Now’ seeks to improve the overall framework for women-led businesses in the country and offer dedicated incubation and acceleration programmes for women entrepreneurs.\n\nThe initiative was set in motion earlier this month (October 2019) at Siloam in Meghalaya. Following a set of selection interviews, 80 women entrepreneurs were invited to take part in the incubation and acceleration programme. The participants came from various parts of the Northeast and ideas ranged from handicrafts, organic foods to fitness centres.\n\nDhriiti – The Courage Within has joined hands with GIZ to be the regional implementation partner in the Northeast. The organisation would be offering incubation support to 130 women-led start-ups over the next two years.

    "post_content": "Girls at the grassroots level must be equipped with technology if women entrepreneurship is to be given a boost. This was the consensus that emerged out of a panel discussion among women experts at an international conclave in Kovalam in September.\n\nThe participants noted that women have only a minuscule representation in the technology sector at present. They were speaking at a panel discussion on 'She is the Boss, She Loves Tech' on the sidelines of 'Huddle Kerala 2019'.\n\nAccording to Kiran Bhat, Founder and MD, Xebec Communication, schools should encourage the adoption of technology by girls. She pointed out that bank finance, and learning and mentoring opportunities are available for women to pursue technology. Underlining the need for more women start-up networks, she said industry experts should come forward voluntarily to mentor women.\n\nPooja Ravishankar, Head, Category Marketing, BigBasket.com felt that there is a need to unshackle women from typecast roles assigned to them and involve them in jobs such as repairing vehicles and electronic goods at home. She noted that when this becomes a culture at home, it will bear fruits in 10-15 years.\n\nRavishankar highlighted that women employees have an attention to detail, but it is very hard to find talented women in mid and higher levels. She cited BigBasket's initiative to employ women delivery executives.\n\nShruti Kannan, Head, Launch pad Startup Accelerator, CISCO, also emphasised on the need for women to break away from stereotypical roles. According to her, the more the number of women, the greater is the quality that they can contribute to the workforce. She also talked about empowering men so that they can support the women.\n\nAnju Chaudhary, Director, Enterprise and Alliances, Builder.ai, spoke about encouraging women and joining hands to make them more powerful.",

Her businesses make substantial contributions to the parent conglomerate.\n\nModi is the wife of noted industrialist KK Modi but has created such a strong portfolio for herself, that she today shines on her own.\n\nDeservingly, Modi has been conferred a Ph.D Honoris Causa, by Dr KN Modi University for her contribution to the fields of design, arts, technology, management, commerce, agriculture, fashion and hospitality.\n\nThe Women Economic Forum had honoured her with the ‘Women of the Decade in Business &amp; Leadership 2018’. She had also found a place on 'India’s Most Powerful Women', a book by Prem Ahluwalia. Modi has also been a winner of the prestigious Achiever’s Award in 2019.\n\nModi has striven to introduce the most modern management and human resource concepts into the functioning of the group.\n\nModi, hailing from an orthodox family, recounted the hurdles she had to overcome in her quest to carve out a niche for herself. Her family did not encourage women working, and so, it was not easy to pursue her ambitions, Modi said. She added that Ph.D Honoris Causa serves as a validation of the obstacles she had to overcome as an entrepreneur.",

    "post_content": "Indian Institute of Management-Kozhikode (IIM-K), in association with oil PSU, Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL), has launched a special programme to identify innovative and promising start-ups founded by women and provide them with comprehensive support.\n\nThe initiative, termed as La Eve (The Woman) is expected to give a major boost to women entrepreneurs. It would be anchored by IIM-K Live (Laboratory for Innovation, Venturing and Entrepreneurship), which is the institute's entrepreneurship development centre, with the support of MRPL's start-up fund.\n\nMRPL had entered into an MoU with IIM-K last year and since then has provided seed capital to over 10 start-ups incubated at the institute.\n\nNew ventures that can be defined as start-ups, are registered under the Companies' Act, and whose founders are mostly women, would be eligible for support under this programme. Even early-stage start-ups with a minimum viable product or at least a proof of concept would be considered for assistance.\n\nThe start-ups selected for support would be given seed funds amounting to Rs 25 lakh, along with a structured incubation programme and task-based mentoring, access to professional services, co-working space, subsidised training and workshops, and numerous other on-campus benefits.\n\nIIM-K Director Debashis Chatterjee underlined that promotion and support of women entrepreneurship can contribute significantly to the economic goals of the country.\n\nAccording to Keyoor Purani, Executive Director, IIM-K Live, a large number of educated and skilled women prefer to work on own terms rather than in traditional jobs. He pointed out that technological developments have resulted in time and location neutrality, and this has allowed many women to start up and lead ventures that can create economic value and make a social impact. This trend must be channelised for innovation-led entrepreneurship.\n\nAn MRPL spokesperson highlighted that according to the website of Start-up India, women-led ventures perform 63% better than those controlled by men in terms of return on investment. Women have displayed unparalleled willingness and capacity to organise, develop, and manage a business venture, according to the spokesperson.",

    "post_content": "Prime Narendra Modi's pet project Startup India has gone the whole hog in backing women entrepreneurs. It has come up with a programme called WING-Women Rise Together, which aims at identifying and facilitating both aspiring and established women entrepreneurs by improving their access to incubation, investors and various business support systems.\n\nThe Startup India is supported in this initiative to build the capacity of women entrepreneurs by the government's department for the promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT).\n\nStartup India recognises that from running sports media firms to construction companies and security and detective agencies, women are entering fields that have hitherto been considered to be male bastions. It notes that today women entrepreneurs come from not only established business families, or from higher-income sections of the society, but from all walks of life and all parts of the country.\n\nAccording to the Sixth Economic Census of the ministry of statistics and programme implementation, 14% of all entrepreneurs in India are women. The WING-Women Rise initiative looks to support at least 7,500 women entrepreneurs over the next one year.\n\nThe first leg of the programme had been planned to be launched in Kerala and then spread out to the rest of the country. The Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), along with LetsVenture have been given the charge of implementing the project in all the southern states -- Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka -- by Invest India, the national investment promotion and facilitation agency focusing on sector-specific investor targeting and development of new partnerships to bring about sustainable investments in the country.\n\nIn September this year, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan unveiled the Kerala edition of the programme at Huddle Kerala 2019.\n\nThe programme would be implemented in the East, West, North, and North-East by KIIT-TBI, Startup Oasis, FITT-IIT Delhi, and Singex respectively.",

The start-up doing the most impactful work in the social sector and a new-age company working in the realm of agriculture, healthcare and water management would also be awarded.\n\nThe Sixth Economic Census, released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, has found that women make up only about 14% of all entrepreneurship in the country. This means that only 8.05 million out of a total of 58.29 million entrepreneurs are women.\n\nA government official, aware of the MeitY's plan to reward women entrepreneurs, told The Economic Times that the idea is to build software products and inspire women to take up entrepreneurship more and more. The government had recently unveiled a draft policy for software products.\n\nThe MeitY has joined hands with IT industry body National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) for the awards and close to 650 nominations have already been received.\n\nSnapdeal CEO and Founder Kunal Bahl, Saurabh Srivastava of TiE, Nasscom president Debjani Ghosh, and Meity secretary Ajay Sawhney are among those part of the jury.\n\nThe awards would be given away by Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister for Electronics, IT and Communications during the launch of the startup hub on October 21.",

    "post_content": "Former chairperson of the State Bank of India (SBI), Arundhati Bhattacharya has said that lack of adequate financing is a major concern for women entrepreneurs. Raising funds through equity and providing collateral for debt are the two main areas in which women entrepreneurs lag behind, she felt. Bhattacharya lamented that there is still a stereotype that women can't handle money, which holds back female entrepreneurship.\n\nBhattacharya, currently, the chairperson of Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), India, pointed out that though equity is needed for a business to flourish, women find it far more difficult than men to raise money, despite the fact that women are considerably better than men in repayment of debt.\n\nEquity here refers to the money that would be returned to a company's shareholders if all the assets of the company were liquidated and debts paid off. Companies may periodically sell shares to raise money, either to fulfill a short-term need of paying bills, or a long-term objective of investing in its growth.\n\nCollateral is an asset that the borrower offers as security for a loan. In the case of non-repayment of the loan, the lender can take over the property and sell it to recoup losses. Bhattacharya felt that collateral appears as a problem area for women especially when they try to scale their businesses.\n\nWomen entrepreneurs, while raising funds, are also a little shy in stating upfront the kind of growth trajectory they have envisaged for their businesses. This timidness hurts their chances of getting funds, according to Bhattacharya. She gave the examples of startup owners aggressively pitching for finance, laying out plans for growth even to the tune of 300-500%. Women entrepreneurs, however, are much more muted in this regard.\n\nThe former SBI boss highlighted that there are only about 19% women entrepreneurs in India, and often women as only figurative heads in companies, with the men functioning as the real decision-makers from the background.\n\nBhattacharya has been a prime example of women breaking the glass ceiling in the corporate sphere. She was the first woman chairperson of the largest PSU lender in the country - SBI in over 200 years. She was the first woman to lead an India-based Fortune 500 company. She was the only Indian corporate leader in Fortune's list of the top-50 greatest leaders of the world, sitting pretty at 26. In 2016, Forbes ranked her as the 25th most powerful woman in the world.",

With 44% of the board comprising women, and with the aim of creating a senior leadership team of 40% women by 2025, Diageo has taken the lead in breaking the proverbial glass ceiling.\n\nThe certificate for the Diageo's stellar work in this regard comes from the Equileap 2019 Global Gender Equality Report and Ranking, which ranks the company as No 1 globally. Diageo has improved its Equileap ranking from 11th last year. It has been ranked as the best company in the United Kingdom in terms of gender equality for the second consecutive year.\n\nThe Equileap report is a detailed measurement of gender equality in 3,519 companies across various sectors in 23 developed economies. It covers 98 million employees and ranks businesses on the basis of 19 criteria for gender equality. These criteria include gender balance across the workforce, the gender pay gap, paid parental leave and anti-sexual harassment policies among others.\n\nWomen occupy key leadership positions in departments ranging from legal, finance, marketing, communications, human resources and sales (23%) in the company at present, and taking up specialised roles in research and development, innovation and public policy teams. In India, 17% of the company's employees consist of women as compared to only 7.5% in 2015.\n\nDiageo chief executive Ivan Menezes expressed pride at the company's work to build an inclusive culture and diverse employee base. He said that the company's objective is to create a culture that ensures all people thrive while shaping market-leading policies and practices.\n\nMairéad Nayager, Chief HR Officer, Diageo, termed gender equality as a moral imperative and a driver of business performance.",

She wanted them to be able to share their stories while simultaneously helping them find jobs.\n\nA former journalist, Sairee started Sheroes in 2014. She is based out of Noida. The concept was also inspired by her previous start-up named Fleximoms which catered to new moms who had quit their jobs. The start-up helped connect them to career opportunities which were flexible timewise.\n\nThe Sheroes website acts as a career counselling helpline on which women can speak to counsellors and coaches and seek support, advice or resources for their own businesses. The website also helps connect businesses to women professionals for special projects and initiatives based on their availability.\n\nSairee also hosts a Sheroes summit online. In this, women share their stories of opportunity and inspiration. Mentors are also present at the summit to help professionals connect with the right businesses.",

When a job application is rejected because somebody has no working knowledge of English, it becomes a necessity.\n\nCultureAlley, that Pranshu has co-founded, taps right into it. She founded it with Nishant Patani in 2013.\n\nTheir HelloEnglish app has brought about significant change in the teaching of English as a language of work. The app grew from zero to seven million users in its year of inception. On the CultureAlley website, one can register and learn a language for free or hire an expert for one-on-one Skype lessons.\n\nThe audio-visual lessons available on the website are self-paced, and helps the learner with vocabulary, phrases and mastering conversations while also assigning practice quizzes and assignments.\n\nTop multinationals have paired up with HelloEnglish and are using it as a part of their corporate social responsibility wing. HelloEnglish is scalable, in that it provides standardised teaching and assessing methods and is also measurable as business owners can use the rigorous assignments and quizzes to quantify learning. More and more companies are approaching HelloEnglish as owners want to make their workforce equipped and efficient.\n\nIncidentally, Pranshu was awarded the CNBC Young Business Women Award in 2018.",

The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) -- the pre-eminent voice of the country's business and industry -- has struck a partnership with the Griffith Business School in Australia to work towards enhancing business opportunities among female entrepreneurs in India.\n\nThe FICCI Ladies' Organisation (FLO) is spearheading this initiative for the apex industry body, and innovators from the Australian state of Queensland and women entrepreneurs from India are sought to be brought on the same platform. 'Going Global', a two-phase project, in this regard, has been devised to boost networking. The project consists of 'Masterclasses' conducted in New Delhi and Bangalore in September 2019.\n\nThe idea of the whole exercise is to increase cross-cultural employability and global entrepreneurial mindset among both the Indian and Australian entrepreneurs. The first phase of 'Masterclass' would be followed by 10 Indian women innovators being invited to witness and absorb the entrepreneurial and business environment of Queensland.\n\nPresident of FLO, Harjinder Kaur Talwar, stressed upon the creating international linkages and deepening business ties among women. She said that women are the key agents for economic, environmental and social changes that can bring about gender equality. She noted that women are one of the main drivers of the partnership between India and Australia.\n\nFLO has a rich experience in this field, having created entrepreneurship programmes with institutions like ISB, IIM Lucknow, and IIM Ahmedabad.\nMichelle Barker of the Department of Business Strategy and Innovation, Griffith Business School welcomed individually tailored and context-specific masterclasses and programmes that train women entrepreneurs to be effective in culturally, linguistically and socially different environments, and help them to trump personal and professional challenges.",

    "post_content": "Anita Sharma was paralysed from the waist below when she was barely six months old and says the happiest moment of her life was when she could finally drive her own car when she turned 28.\n\nAfter calling many driving schools around the country, Anita decided to start her own to help all Persons with Disabilities (PwD) to learn how to drive.\n\nOn My Own was founded in 2017 in Amritsar, Punjab. The cars that the driving schools use are retrofitted with the accelerators and breaks located on the top rather than at the bottom like in usual cars. A nominal fee is charged for all those who come to the institute to learn how to drive and a portion of the fees collected is donated towards charities that provide wheelchairs for the needy.\n\nBesides regular driving lessons, there are also conversations over coffee where Anita helps people with disabilities get driving licenses and retrofitted cars.\n\nAnita also organises workshops and seminars where she takes the role of a motivational speaker and advises people with disabilities on how best to get driving licences in different states across the country. She has successfully organised two workshops so far and has also trained 16 people in driving as she prefers to teach one student at a time.\n\nOn the website <a href=\"https:\/\/driveonmyown.com\">https:\/\/driveonmyown.com<\/a>, you can also gift a driving session for persons with disabilities and read all about the aim of the organisation and what plans Anita Sharma has for the future.",

What is so special about BlinkGreen?\n\nThey make footwear which is upcycled from tyre scraps. Sourced from a local ragpicker, the tyre scraps mainly belong to trucks and are then upcycled into fashionable footwear by local cobblers and tailors who make it colourful. All the designs are made by Pooja herself.\n\nShe put things in motion with Rs 50,000 she won as Upcoming woman entrepreneur in the event organised by Startup Yatra.\n\nAll her footwear is priced around Rs 500 per pair to ensure affordability. The footwear comes in three varieties – classic (for those who want durability), trendy (for the teenagers looking for fashion) and vintage (designed and customised).\n\nNamed Memital, a Sanskrit word where ‘memi’ means tyre and ‘tal’ means sole, BlinkGreen has produced 70 pairs of footwear from its inception. Pooja plans to scale up the business once the number reaches 100 and aims to adopt a push-pull method of business. She will supply footwear through e-commerce websites while simultaneously customising footwear for fashion boutiques across the country.\n\nOnce the business scales up, Pooja also plans to source tyre scraps from the Mumbai dockyard where they will be available in larger quantities. All branding for BlinkGreen is currently being done on social media and Pooja plans to expand into her own website which is currently under design.",

At 38, she runs her own manufacturing unit in Nari, while also offering employment opportunities to the women in her village.\n\nAlthough her husband lost his job and the family did not have the income to feed their children and keep themselves afloat, Godavari remained determined. But when she spotted a paper lamp at a local market, she knew what she had to do.\n\nFaced with difficulties to invest in her paper lamp making business, she borrowed money from her relatives without interest as banks had turned her away. Eventually the Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust came forward to financially aid the business and offered entrepreneurial guidance to develop her business further.\n\nThe company called ‘Godavari Akashkandil’ registered a revenue of Rs 30 lakh in 2013, and Godavari Satpute was awarded Woman Entrepreneur of the year award at the Youth International Business Awards in the same year.\n\nEmploying many women from her village, Godavari aims to ensure that every woman employed is financially independent and does not feel the burden of choice among at least basic necessities. She also provides creche and educational facilities for the children of her women employees to help them get a better life. Godavar has also appointed a doctor whom one can approach in case of medical emergencies.",

    "post_content": "In a conference held in Mumbai earlier this month, Metropolis Healthcare managing director Ameera Shah has said that starting a small business could be extremely lonely. She shared anecdotes on how her success and failures were affected by mentors or the absence of one, according to reports.\n\nSpeaking to a group of gathered HR professionals, she said, “Being a woman entrepreneur multiplied the loneliness. Often, you want to reach out to your friends and talk to people in various situations. Unfortunately, I did not have the ecosystem of friends that I could reach out to. I wasn’t born in a business family. There were no uncles or aunts that I could reach out to.”\n\nShah, 40, went on to emphasize the need for successful people to talk about what went wrong in their path to achieve success while also telling entrepreneurs where they went right. From 2012, Shah decided to build for herself a circle of mentors who helped her achieve her goals.\n\nWhile stressing the need for people around a start-up to help and aid in growth, she also said the practice of one’s own values, ethics and morals along with a sense of gratitude towards the relationships formed during the course of work will ensure success.\n\nDespite the measures one takes to be successful, Ameera Shah says there was bigger satisfaction in seeking help in crisis without being burdened or pressured in to knowing everything.",

    "post_content": "A three-day event organised by Tie Global in partnership with the US\nembassy marked the start of mentorship program AIRSWEEE (All India\nRoadshow for Women’s Economic Empowerment through Entrepreneurship)\nScale-Up Fellowships last month.\n\nSeema Chaturvedi, chairman of AIRSWEEE, said women were more aware of environmental necessities in society as they have generally been addressed as problem solvers in the Indian context. This is why, she said, woman entrepreneurs come up with sustainable ideas.\n\nAsked about where India stood globally in terms of the opportunities that women entrepreneurs receive, former secretary of the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade Ramesh Abhishek said, “We still have a long way to go in the Indian start-up industry, in which roughly 10% are female founders. It's because the ecosystem doesn’t support women. But attention is slowly going towards this and I think there’s a lot of support coming in to change the narrative. We have to take extra measures to ensure that women entrepreneurs attain a bigger milestone.”\n\nThe AIRSWEEE project, launched in 2016, has empowered more\nthan 575 women in the country across 100 cities in 20 states. In 2019,\na group of selected mentors from the USA interacted with Indian based\nentrepreneurs in order to develop a resource based understanding of\nhow to empower women entrepreneurs.\n\nAll women selected through the programme will travel to the United\nStates for 10 days where they will follow closely the work of CEOs of\naligned global companies. The three selected entrepreneurs for this\nyear are Tharakeshwari Palanisamy, founder and CEO of Ganya Agro\nProducts Pvt Ltd; Shraddha Khare, Director of Instant Rasoi OPC Pvt. Ltd; and Zaiba Sarang, founder of iThink Logistics, a Mumbai-based company engaged in AI-driven technology for the Indian logistics industry.\n\nThe project is also ready to hit Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities in the country.",

    "post_content": "Suchita Oswal Jain spins over a billion dollars a year at the head of the Vardhman Textiles Limited, leading the country’s largest textiles conglomerate engaged in manufacturing yarns, fabric, threads, fibre, and garments with exports to over 40 countries.\n\nIn an interview given to website <a href=\"http:\/\/yourstory.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YourStory<\/a>, Suchita explained how she joined the family business at a young age of 22, some two decades ago.\n\nWhile there weren’t many women at the helm of companies back then, she says she never felt awkward as it “came from within”.\n\n“There is just one key to success in any field, and that is passion. You must have&nbsp;<em>junoon&nbsp;<\/em>for whatever you do,” she says.\n\n<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>Suchita explains why she joined the family business when “I could have joined any other company or started something of my own.” She knew there were opportunities within the Vardhman Group where she could contribute.\n\n“However, when I was growing up, I realised there were opportunities in the group itself where I could contribute in bringing efficiencies, taking the company to new geographies and to new heights. Thus, there was natural synergy between my attitude, skill set, and the opportunities,” Suchita said.\n\nBorn in Ludhiana, Punjab, Suchita completed her Master’s in commerce from&nbsp;the Punjab University and went on to complete the Accelerated Development Programme from&nbsp;London School of Business, and the Special Programme on Project Management from&nbsp;IIM-Ahmedabad.\n\nReminiscing her sojourns to factories as a teenager, she says she realised down the line that business of weaving and fabrics requires a lot of attention to detail and a good sense and appreciation for colours, patterns, and fashion trends and&nbsp;she was able to identify a lot of areas where she could contribute significantly&nbsp;in bringing economies and efficiencies.\n\nSuchita set up the&nbsp;Woven Fabric Division<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>of the group with a capacity of over 180 million metres per year. The company&nbsp;exports yarn to around 40 countries overseas, while its production is spread across Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh, employing over 28,000 people. Suchita has established connections with such global giants as GAP, Benetton,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Esprit.\n\nAs part of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Suchita has been instrumental in steering the production towards environment-friendly practices.\n\n“I can say&nbsp;with a&nbsp;little bit of pride that I have been instrumental in making Vardhman Group country’s largest textiles conglomerate engaged in manufacturing of yarns, fabric, threads,&nbsp;fibre, and&nbsp;garments with a&nbsp;total turnover of nearly $1.1 billion today,” she says.\n\n“We have been able to augment or set up&nbsp;physical infrastructure in many schools, including setting up of classrooms, toilets, desks, water purifiers, and other such arrangements that ensure children and teachers can focus on education and not worry about health issues. We are also helping Sri Aurobindo College of Commerce in Ludhiana to construct ‘Mother Auditorium’ in the college. I am also involved in a new CSR project, which is called ‘Nandini’. It’s an initiative to help rural women and young girls break the silence on menstrual hygiene and health,” Sucita adds.\n\nThe group has employed 1,000 women at its location in Madhya Pradesh where they are also provided with hostel facilities.\n\nSpeaking about the period of 1992-99 when the fabric business was in its nascent stages, Suchita remembers the challenges. These included achieving operational excellence, human resource training, skill enhancement, marketing, and profitability.\n\n“The decision to serve the toughest quality conscious market of Europe within a year of inception shortened the gestation period. We achieved what we set out to do, despite the quota regime and anti-dumping duties,” she adds.\n\nAccording to Suchita, the highs have “not been coming in bits and pieces, but in a continuous flow forming a beautiful stream”.\n\n“Ever since I joined the Woven Fabric Division of the group back in 1990s, it has become one of the growth engines, and is still expanding and growing. Because it is still growing and we, as a group, are able to add to new foreign destinations for exports every now and then, I think the highest high is still to come!”\n\nSuchita is married to Sachit Jain, and has two daughters, Saumya and Sagarika. Both were very young when she joined the business. “I would&nbsp;juggle between work and family, but got adequate support from my husband and family members. My husband always encouraged me. Now my girls are grown up so I can dedicate more time to the business.”",

    "post_content": "As China plummets in gender equality rankings amid discrimination even after 70 years of Mao's&nbsp;Revolution, the girl child has come to bear the brunt of the one-child policy of the government.\n\nOwing to the policy, according to a report in Al Jazeera<strong>, <\/strong>the country is facing grave problems such as abortions based on sex which are often forced. This, on top of the dangerous population imbalance, which has resulted in a surplus of over 30 million men.\n\nThe report cited that gender equality had gone awry in Communist China even as women accounted for nearly 41% of the GDP of the country. For the fifth straight year, China plummeted in the&nbsp;World Economic Forum’s global gender gap&nbsp;index.\n\nRanked 57th out of 139 countries in 2008, China is now 103rd among 149 countries. In terms of “health and survival”, it ranked last.\n\nSo blatant is the discrimination against women that nearly one-fifth of the positions for national civil service jobs listed “male” as core requirement. This follows a trend in prestigious positions in other industries too, according to a 2018 Human Rights Watch report.\n\nThe report&nbsp;cited a study released by online recruiter Boss Zhipin. Chinese women earned 78.2 cents for every dollar paid to a man, a drop of nearly 9% from the year before.\n\nEven the party is aware of this. According to an official party survey released in 2017, 54% of Chinese women reported discrimination in job interviews.\n\nOnline recruiter Zhilian Zhaopin found instances sex discrimination heightened for women in the age group of 25 and 35 as this is the most likely time to start a family.\n\nThis discrimination continues even when women get older. The mandated age of retirement for women in some industries is 50 years, which is 10 years earlier than for men, making any professional advance impossible.\n\nAccording to Al Jazeera, the gender gap is most apparent in politics. The report said, “In 70 years, not one woman has ever been appointed to the country’s highest governing body, the Politburo Standing Committee. Among the wider 25-person Politburo, only one woman is included, and of 31 provincial-level governments, not one is led by a woman.”",

She is among the 175 contestants who will represent India. She auditioned in February this year after she got a call from the Haute Monde Mrs India Worldwide 2019 beauty pageant, Season 9.\n\nIn 2018, Tanisha underwent surgery for Pleomorphic Adenoma, a salivary gland tumour, because there were no medication options to remove it, she told website&nbsp;<strong><em><a href=\"http:\/\/yourstory.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YourStory<\/a>. <\/em><\/strong>\n\n“The surgery was a macro-surgery. I was cut open from the lobe of my left ear and down my neck; if the surgery had gone wrong, I would have been paralysed with my facial nerves twisted. The results were shocking,” she said.\n\n\"I was diagnosed with cancer in one of the strains in the biopsy results. My tumour has turned malignant. I was still thankful that I had been diagnosed in the early stages, which are quite rare in this disease. I took appropriate treatments to arrest the growth,” Tanisha said.\n\n<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>Roy then posted a great comeback when after putting on a lot of weight post-surgery and body-shamed by her friends and neighbours, she hit the gym. She says she understood the importance of self-love and self-care.\n\n“I nourished my body with good thoughts and nutritious food, and cut off all things that were toxic for me.&nbsp;Be it food, drinks, or even harmful relationships (pseudo friends, relatives who were draining energy from me instead of healing me),” Tanisha says. Her efforts paid off as she lost almost 25 kg in the regained her confidence.\n\nTanisha was born and raised in Kharagpur, West Bengal. She moved to Bengaluru after Class 12. She has a master’s degree in biotechnology and has worked in the corporate sector for more than 10 years, starting with Kingfisher Airlines as a Guest Relation Executive and moving up the ladder slowly to a Manager of Corporate Communication and finishing with General&nbsp;Electric, where she handled corporate events.",

Since 2014, our Everteen Menstrual Hygiene Surveys have mapped emerging trends and preferences of Indian women,” CEO of Wet and DryPersonalCare Hariom Tyagi was quoted as saying. “We are also one of the participating members of the global Menstrual Hygiene Day held annually with the support of UNICEF, USAID, and other organisations.”\n\nThe digital campaign has already crossed a million in online traffic, most of them presumably women.\n\nParticipants in the digital initiative were able to resolve many of their issues related to the use of the menstrual cups in regional languages.\n\nTyagi said video-based learning helped create awareness in the Fix Your Periods campaign. “Creating awareness on complete feminine hygiene is the need of the hour, and video-based education has emerged as one of the most effective means for it,” she reportedly said.\n\nCampaign organisers found that nearly 20 per cent of the girls were unaware that menstrual cups give them the mobility and freedom to pursue outdoor stuff.\n\nAnd another 8 per cent did not know that menstrual cups created a vacuum seal that provided them leak-proof protection, reports said.\n\nSocial media influencers helped the girls choose the right size of the menstrual cup, guided how to insert and remove the menstrual cup and on other crucial details. The campaign cleared several myths around menstrual hygiene.",

Little access to quality education and major social and economic barriers were limiting the opportunities for women, a Deloitte report said.\n\nThe Deloitte report, ‘Empowering Women &amp; Girls in India’ for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, said 95% or 195 million women were employed in the unorganised sector or were in unpaid work.\n\nA lot more of them could join the workforce and some of them could lead successful businesses if the UNCTAD’s efforts bear fruit.",
