At home, good design fosters comfort and well-being; in commercial settings, it strengthens brand identity, attracts clients and talent, and boosts productivity. Today, we are joined by Ms. Tanya Aggarwal, who truly understands this concept and brings it to life through her venture, Casainterio. As the Founder and Design Head of Casainterio, she strives to blend modern trends with classic charm to help clients transform their spaces into highly functional, personalized sanctuaries. Founded in 2019, and based in Delhi NCR, her firm designs beautiful, functional, and sustainable spaces that reflect each client’s personality and needs. Her work spans both residential and commercial projects, offering thoughtful, tailored solutions.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Quote – “<em>Confidence and determination are key to overcoming challenges and achieving your goals<\/em>”.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1. What sparked your interest in interior design and how has your creative vision evolved since you began?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My interest in interior design has been long standing. I have always been drawn to spaces that seamlessly blend functionality with aesthetic. I often found myself envisioning new ways to decorate and enhance spaces.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I have grown as a designer, my creative vision has evolved to focus more on creating spaces that not only look beautiful but also promote well-being. My goal is to create spaces that are functional and sustainable for the long term.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. As a woman entrepreneur in a competitive, creative field, what challenges\/ biases have you faced and how did you navigate them?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a women entrepreneur in a competitive creative industry, I have indeed faced quite a number of challenges, one being constant underestimation and unequal opportunities. To navigate these biases, I have focused on staying adaptable in an ever-changing environment. I have also learnt to communicate my ideas clearly and confidently, which has helped me build strong relationships with clients. My work vouches for my credibility and that has helped me navigate various challenges on my entrepreneurial journey so far.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. How do you balance your creative vision with the practical demands of daily life and clients?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the most important things that has worked in my favor is clear communication with clients and prioritising their needs. Each client is unique, with different demands and visions for their dream space. By understanding their priorities, I am able to balance both the needs.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. How do you remain creatively fresh in a field that's constantly changing - what inspires you when you aren't designing?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To stay creatively fresh, I enjoy exploring exhibitions, following inspiring designers on social media and magazines. Travelling and immersing myself in new cultures. Trying new restaurants also contributes in enhancing my creativity!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. Looking ahead, what is your bigger vision for your brand?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My vision is to build a brand that goes beyond offering exceptional interior design services—a brand that actively enhances well-being, encourages sustainable living, and creates meaningful change. I aspire to design spaces that uplift people’s daily lives while minimizing environmental impact through conscious material choices and responsible practices.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Looking ahead, I hope to expand my work globally, bringing thoughtful, human-centric design to communities around the world. As the brand grows, I aim to contribute to society through initiatives that support education, empowerment, and sustainable development, ensuring that the impact of my work extends far beyond the spaces I create.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>6. Any words of wisdom for other women who aspire to follow in your footsteps?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My advice to aspiring women entrepreneurs is to stay true to your passion and values. Build a support network, seek mentorship, and be open to learning from your mistakes. Confidence and determination are key to overcoming challenges and achieving your goals. Don't be afraid to take risks and trust your instincts, and always prioritise self-care to maintain your physical and mental well-being.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

      "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Holistic wellness is a real thing today and <em>you<\/em> definitely need it! Of late, holistic wellness has been highly embellished – and rightly so! Holistic wellness encompasses mental, emotional, and physical health and gauging its importance, Ms. Preeti Singh, launched “Sattva Nation”. Describing her venture as ‘a festival of holistic wellness’, Ms. Singh aims to spread wellness in the society and also help youth\/women achieve the purpose of their life. Till date, she has inspired countless women nationwide and she truly believes that, true beauty transcends appearance—it reflects the grace and grit of the mind and the depth of the soul.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sattva Nation works on eight Dimensions of Wellness: occupational, emotional, spiritual, environmental, financial, physical, social, and intellectual. The organization also does various Festivals, Webinars, Events, Conferences (Corporate, Universities, Government Institutions) and provides wellness experts on a common platform. Having such a holistic approach to wellness programs aids individuals to develop and become their best selves; and that is exactly what Ms. Singh, Founder of Sattva Nation, aspires to do!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Quote- “Respect your journey, no matter how small it seems”.<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>What inspired you to become a wellness crusader?<\/strong><\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item --><\/ol>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Becoming a wellness crusader was never a conscious decision—it happened to me almost accidentally. I truly believe it was given to me by God as a purpose of life, albeit under unfortunate circumstances. During the pandemic, I was going through one of the most difficult phases of my life. I lost my father on the very first day of the lockdown. The world around me was in chaos—every individual, every family, every nation was going through a collective trauma. Economies were crashing, people were struggling physically, emotionally, and mentally—and yet, in the middle of all this pain, the only thing that was flourishing was Mother Nature.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Corona period taught me what truly matters in life. I realized that the things we often keep chasing—money, career, ambition, or social validation—do not matter as much as we think. What truly matters is the food we eat, the emotions we carry, and the relationships we hold close. I understood that the most essential things in life—clean air, pure water, nourishing food, love, and meaningful connections—come to us free and in abundance, yet we are the ones polluting and neglecting them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In that period of reflection, I began reading deeply, to cope with my grief, my health struggles, and the emotional trauma I was carrying. Those readings and my personal healing journey made me realize that wellness is not just about physical fitness—it is about the overall balance of mind, body, spirit, and environment. It made me question and redefine what success truly means.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That is how <em>Sattva Nation<\/em> was born—a vision to create awareness around the eight pillars of wellness: physical, emotional, mental, environmental, spiritual, and intellectual wellness. For me, wellness is no longer just a lifestyle choice—it’s a way of life, a responsibility, and my purpose.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>What is Sattva Nation's core mission and how does it translate into the work you do?<\/strong><\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item --><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The core mission of Sattva Nation is to handhold people towards becoming the best version of their own unique selves. We believe that every individual is the purest and finest creation of God, born with a unique purpose—not to compete with others but to grow, evolve and shine in their own light. Our mission is about guiding people back to their true selves and to the purity and wisdom that already resides within them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The name itself carries this philosophy. <em>Sattva<\/em>—one of the three Gunas mentioned in the Vedas alongside Rajasic and Tamasic—represents purity, balance and wisdom. At Sattva Nation, our work revolves around balancing these aspects to create harmony and holistic wellness in every life we touch.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We translate this mission into action through our focus on <strong>eight pillars of wellness:<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Physical wellness<\/strong> – helping people nurture and strengthen their bodies through fitness and lifestyle choices.<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Emotional &amp; mental wellness<\/strong> – recognizing that as human beings we are made of vibrations and frequencies; our emotions and mental health shape our overall well-being.<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Environmental wellness<\/strong> – reconnecting with Mother Nature, respecting the air, water and food she provides in abundance, and teaching sustainable living so we don’t cut our own roots in the name of urbanization.<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Occupational wellness<\/strong> – creating awareness about peaceful, positive and productive workspaces where people spend most of their day, helping them evolve as professionals and humans.<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Financial wellness<\/strong> – running workshops and programs that teach saving, planning and building a secure foundation for a dignified life.<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Intellectual wellness<\/strong> – encouraging people to pursue hobbies, passions, and meaningful conversations with like-minded communities, instead of postponing the things that truly bring them joy and growth.<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Social wellness<\/strong> – reminding us that we are social beings who thrive on healthy relationships and strong communities.<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Spiritual wellness<\/strong> – guiding individuals to connect with their own inner self and with the universal power, beyond religion, to find peace and purpose.<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item --><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Based on these ‘pillars’, <em>Sattva Nation<\/em> runs workshops, seminars, conferences, and community activities across colleges, corporates, and institutions. We’ve built a tribe—a supportive community that transcends caste, race, or financial background—where we handhold, uplift, and empower each other.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At its heart, Sattva Nation is about living with balance, giving back, and rediscovering the wisdom and purity already within us.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Can you illustrate some wellness programs you have implemented and their impact?<\/strong><\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item --><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We started very small, with a simple intention—to bring genuine change in people’s lives. Our first programs were conducted in colleges, where we focused on personality development, mental health, and spiritual awareness. The idea was to help the youth—the next generation—understand the importance of emotional well-being and self-awareness.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Through these sessions, students understood how to manage their emotions, recognize their triggers, and respond to life’s challenges with greater balance. Over time, we saw a beautiful transformation—young minds becoming more emotionally intelligent, resilient, and confident in their own identity.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our next major initiative was in the space of <strong>environmental wellness<\/strong>. We began celebrating <em>World Environment Day<\/em> in a big way, conducting workshops with MCD school children and encouraging them to plant trees. We created a tradition of planting a tree on special occasions—like birthdays, anniversaries, or milestones—turning celebrations into a contribution to Mother Earth. This initiative was not just about planting trees; it was about cultivating responsibility, gratitude, and awareness for the environment in every individual.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of our flagship programs, the <strong>Sattva Iconic Wellness Awards<\/strong>, holds a very special place in our journey. Through these awards, we recognize individuals who are silently creating meaningful impact in society—without seeking personal gain. From women in rural India who are empowering others financially and emotionally, to heroes like <em>Constable Seema Dhaka<\/em>, who rescued 16 young girls from a trafficking racket, to doctors, artists, and classical performers preserving India’s heritage—we celebrate their contribution and give them the recognition they deserve. Our goal has always been to make these unsung heroes visible, because they truly represent the spirit of a “New India.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another initiative very close to my heart is our <strong>Women Empowerment Program<\/strong>. Through workshops and seminars, we address issues that affect women across rural and urban spaces—be it financial literacy, awareness about workplace rights, or understanding the POSH Act. The response has been incredible. We’ve seen women gain confidence, take charge of their finances, and stand stronger in their workplaces and communities.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, one of our newest and most transformative initiatives is our <strong>Spiritual Wellness Workshop and Retreats<\/strong>, which has also been appreciated by the Ministry. These programs are not about religion—they are about universal energy, self-connection, and inner peace. In these retreats, participants step away from the chaos of city life for three or four days and immerse themselves in nature-based experiences—morning yoga, afternoon meditation, evening intellectual activities, creative sessions like painting and sketching, and even moments of silence. The results have been profound—people return more focused, calmer, and spiritually awakened.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each of these initiatives empowers people to become their best selves—embodying Sattva Nation’s spirit of conscious, balanced growth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>What does the road ahead look like for you?<\/strong><\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item --><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The road ahead for me, as the founder of Sattva Nation, looks truly beautiful. For us, it’s not about reaching a destination — it’s about cherishing the journey itself, because the journey is the real reward.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Going forward, our focus is on introducing <strong>Life Skills Programs<\/strong>, which are designed to teach people the art of living life at its best. In today’s world, everyone is chasing success, and validation — but somewhere along the way, we’ve lost touch with the essence of simply <em>living well happily<\/em>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At <em>Sattva Nation<\/em>, we believe that true happiness is an inner state — a skill that can be cultivated with awareness, discipline, and gratitude.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I talk about life skills, I mean learning how to:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Understand and manage one’s emotions,<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Be self-aware and independent in finding joy,<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Practice happiness as a conscious choice rather than a result of external circumstances.<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item --><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We often take inspiration from both ancient wisdom and modern examples. Like Jim Carrey once said — “I wish everyone could get rich and famous so they’d know it’s not the answer.” Similarly, even at the peak of her success, Deepika Padukone spoke openly about her struggle with depression. These stories reiterate that fulfilment doesn’t come from fame or money, but from emotional wellness and inner balance.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our vision for the future includes <strong>building a strong, compassionate community<\/strong> — not defined by religion, but united by empathy, openness, and mutual respect. We want to initiate the creation of a generation that listens, understands, and supports one another.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We are also working towards <strong>launching wellness festivals<\/strong> that beautifully merge ancient Indian sciences with modern practices — such as celebrating <em>Maha Shivratri<\/em> as a festival of spiritual wellness, or creating cultural and intellectual events that promote art, reading, and creativity.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another key step ahead is <strong>introducing Sattva Memberships<\/strong> — a collective movement that welcomes everyone, from school students to professionals, to be part of initiatives like tree planting, meditation, wellness workshops, and the <em>Sattva Iconic Awards<\/em>. The goal is to make wellness a way of life — not an occasional effort.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our long-term vision is to make <strong>meditation and mindfulness<\/strong> a part of the school curriculum, with dedicated meditation centres across educational institutions. We strongly believe that once you know yourself better, you stop running the endless race of comparison and start living a more meaningful, peaceful life.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ultimately, the road ahead is about redefining success — from what we <em>own<\/em> to who we <em>are<\/em>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Any ‘satvik’ suggestions for someone wishing to follow in&nbsp;your&nbsp;footsteps?<\/strong><\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item --><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Sattva Nation<\/em> happened to me when I was at the peak of my career. I was enjoying all the luxuries one could imagine — a good position, recognition, financial stability — and yet, there was a strange emptiness inside me. I kept asking myself, <em>“Is this it? Is this what life is really about?”<\/em> That feeling made me realize that success and fulfilment are not always the same thing.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On a lighter note, I often say — <em>I started my journey on a bicycle, and today I drive a BMW.<\/em> But the real journey wasn’t from the bicycle to the BMW — it was from confusion to clarity, from achievement to purpose.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What I’ve learned through this path is that everyone’s story is unique. Some people start from humble beginnings; others begin from comfort and privilege. Our challenges, struggles, and timelines differ, but what connects us all is the pursuit of meaning and self-growth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s what <em>Sattva Nation<\/em> stands for — helping people become the <em>best version of their own identity<\/em>. You can always have mentors, inspirations, and role models — and you should. But do not imitate. You are your own story.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can draw strength from others’ journeys, but always remember — your circumstances are different, your challenges are different, and so your victories will also be different. The key is to stay grateful for where you are and who you’re becoming.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When people ask me what inspired <em>Sattva Nation<\/em>, I always say — it was born from my lowest phase. I had just lost my father, and it felt like I had lost a part of myself. But instead of letting that pain break me, I decided to turn it into purpose — to build something that reflects his values, his strength, and his belief that being kind, ambitious, and independent can coexist beautifully.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, my only advice to anyone wishing to follow in my footsteps is this — take inspiration, but don’t imitate.<br>Respect your journey, no matter how small it seems.<br>And remember, you don’t have to be anyone else’s version of success — just be <em>your own<\/em>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ms. Preeti Singh<br>Additional Director General, NAREDCO<br>Founder, Sattva Nation<br><br>https:\/\/www.sattvanation.com<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>http:\/\/facebook.com\/Sattva-Nation-109253927467115\/<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCc6XZTICkiWx1lORAPNlwUg\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCc6XZTICkiWx1lORAPNlwUg<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sattvanation\/<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br>https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/sattva-nation-554b761aa<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

IDEMIA believes in making the world safer and more inclusive through innovation, and our CSR work extends this belief to the grassroots level.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In areas like education and employment generation, we focus on creating equitable access to opportunities, especially for those who are often left behind, like underprivileged youth and women.

As a woman and a mother of two daughters, I am especially passionate about creating equal opportunities for girls. When that impact reaches girls from underprivileged backgrounds, it becomes even more meaningful because it doesn’t just change individual lives, it transforms families and future generations.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having worked across diverse roles and sectors, I’ve come to believe that real, lasting change happens when we lead with empathy, listen actively, and build together.

Hence, tech-enabled safety solutions are crucial for women's security, providing tools for immediate help and prevention of potential harm. In line with this thought, we have with us today, Angel Diana Sweetline, a young entrepreneur with a passion for creating a safe environment for women. She recognised the need to ensure women’s safety and developed a unique solution, SheSafe. What’s really impressive about her is her desire to achieve, remain resilient in the face of challenges, and empower women to navigate public spaces with greater confidence.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-q-when-did-you-get-the-big-idea-to-become-independent-and-start-a-tech-enabled-purposeful-platform-for-women\">Q: When did you get the Big Idea to become independent and start a tech-enabled, purposeful platform for women?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The idea for SheSafe was born in the unsafe, not-so-rural, and not-so-urban streets of Erumaiyur, Kanchipuram. That’s where I live, a place with no proper roads, zero streetlights, and constant fear of what might happen after dark. I realized early on that safety shouldn’t be a privilege; it should be a basic right. That frustration turned into determination. I knew I wanted to build a solution for women, by a woman. That was the turning point, the moment I decided not to wait for change, but to become the one creating and driving it.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-q-how-easy-or-tough-has-it-been-for-you-as-a-woman-entrepreneur-to-set-up-and-promote-your-business\">Q: How easy or tough has it been for you, as a woman entrepreneur, to set up and promote your business?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Honestly, it hasn’t been easy, especially coming from a non-technical background and starting young. There were days filled with self-doubt, financial constraints, and constant mockery from people who don’t believe in change. However, each “no” only pushed me harder. I bootstrapped, taught myself, found the right aid, built a prototype from scratch, and pitched tirelessly until I got the recognition that made me “SEEN”.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Being a woman entrepreneur requires a lot of confidence, emotional balance, and resilience, as people around you are always ready to look down upon you.

There will always be people around to tell you that it won’t work, that you are not enough, and that you will not succeed.

It is her expertise in the aviation sector which culminated in establishing her as the Founder &amp; CEO of Eresha Technology Innovators, and eventually also as the Co-Founder of Air Bharath - a brand under Eresha Technology Innovators. She strives to drive innovation in VR\/AI-based Aviation training and elevate India’s safety rankings by strengthening overall flight safety preparedness.

However, being a mother, I’ve felt the inevitable “mom guilt,” even during short absences.

One specific challenge I faced in establishing volunteer networks for social welfare causes was mobilizing and coordinating volunteers for flood relief efforts and Covid care assistance. The key issue was ensuring that volunteers were efficiently managed and that their efforts were directed where they were most needed. To resolve this, I implemented a structured approach: I created clear communication channels and assigned roles based on volunteers’ skills and availability. Additionally, I partnered with local organizations and community leaders to streamline logistics and support. By focusing on transparent processes and regular updates, I ensured that volunteers were motivated and that their contributions had a significant impact. This approach not only enhanced the effectiveness of our relief efforts but also strengthened the overall volunteer network for various social welfare initiatives.

How have your interactions with J.R.D Tata and your philosophy from Zen Shin influenced your leadership style and decision-making over your career?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. Interactions with the late Shri J.R.D. Tata and the philosophy from Zen Shin have profoundly shaped my leadership style and decision-making. J.R.D. Tata’s emphasis on integrity and passion inspired me to approach my entrepreneurial journey with a commitment to co- create meaningful, impactful solutions for my nation. His example instilled in me the importance of aligning personal values with professional endeavours. Additionally, the Zen Shin philosophy, which teaches that \"a flower does not think of competing with the flower next to it; it just blooms,\" has guided my approach to leadership.

I achieve this by setting clear boundaries between work and personal time, prioritizing tasks, and delegating responsibilities where appropriate. I also make time for activities that rejuvenate me, such as exercise, hobbies, and family interactions, ensuring that I stay energized and focused. Regularly evaluating and adjusting my schedule helps me remain productive while also being present in my personal life.

These feelings are amplified for women, but you don’t have to let them eat away into your capabilities and allow them to stop you from charging ahead. Today, we have with us, a woman of sheer grit and intellect, who stands tall as a lawyer and a passionate advocate for responsible tech adoption. Anuradha Chowdhary, founder of ZeroTo3 Collective, is an experienced lawyer, who also specializes in new technologies. She advises AI, Web3, gaming, and tech businesses on corporate structuring, virtual assets licensing, token issuance, IP strategies, and Web3 fundraising.

How did you think about becoming an entrepreneur?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I always knew I would be an entrepreneur- it was an inherent attribute. Exposure to the media and entertainment business, early in life, gave me a first-hand understanding of the creative and business dynamics of the industry. By the time I applied to film school, I was determined to establish my own production house after graduation.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Upon graduating with a degree in filmmaking, I co-founded YelloWarp Productions with two fantastic partners, focusing on ad films. This experience further fuelled my entrepreneurial spirit, but a growing curiosity about how law intersects with business inspired me to pursue a degree in law. After law school, I joined the legal industry, working at many different law firms where I serviced a range of Indian and international clients, from startups to multinational corporations. Through these experiences, I identified gaps in how traditional law firms engaged with clients in emerging industries—especially those involved in disruptive technologies. This realization was pivotal.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I knew it was time to create something that aligned with my ethos: ZeroTo3 Collective. My goal was simple—build a law firm that communicates in a way tech entrepreneurs understand, provides the attention they deserve, and embodies transparency. ZeroTo3 Collective was launched in 2022, but it’s my diverse experiences, coupled with the growth mindset instilled in me by my family, that have guided me along this entrepreneurial journey from a very young age.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ques-what-are-some-strengths-that-a-woman-entrepreneur-should-possess\">Ques.

Resilience helps navigate challenges and setbacks, as I experienced when transitioning from filmmaking to law. Compassion fosters strong, supportive relationships with clients and team members, crucial in diverse fields. Creativity drives innovative solutions and fresh approaches, essential for standing out and adapting in a constantly evolving industry.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ques-could-you-tell-us-about-the-challenges-faced-by-you\">Ques. Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The challenges I faced were significant but rewarding. Establishing a law firm at age 32 in a traditionally conservative industry was a bold move that drew scepticism. However, I identified gaps in the market and was determined to implement a modern approach tailored to the new generation of tech businesses.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Again, navigating a predominantly male-dominated tech industry and finding clients was also challenging, especially given the restrictions on advertising for lawyers. To overcome this, I focused on building my reputation through global conferences, keynotes, and panel discussions, often in male-dominated spaces. Despite the uphill battle, the journey has been immensely fulfilling.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ques-how-is-competition-in-your-business-area\">Ques.

While the broader legal field is indeed competitive, there are very few lawyers focused on disruptive technologies like AI and blockchain. I ventured into this specialized area because I saw a unique opportunity to leverage my background in both law and the creative industry.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Practicing in this field requires a delicate balance: effectively applying existing regulations while creatively anticipating and addressing emerging challenges.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ques-how-did-you-try-to-make-your-business-different\">Ques.

Considering that women and fashion are an endless odyssey, Ambica Chaudhry, has successfully re-introduced a new fashion concept which envelopes mostly Indian cultures and subcultures. ‘Peeli Kothi’ is an ode to the rich textile heritage of our country, which works with weavers and artisans across the country. With Peeli Kothi, Ambica, enables clients to come alive to tradition. Concurrently she also strives tirelessly to justify and reward the love and dedication of craftsmen towards their craft.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques. Tell us a little about your venture. How long ago did you start up? What has been your motivation and what do you aim to achieve?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ans. Peeli Kothi<\/strong> is an Indian ethnic brand that collaborates with artisans from across the country to bring the finest craftsmanship to our customers. Peeli Kothi began as a side hobby to source and style for friends, family, and myself. Over the years, I connected with various karigars (craftsmen) and weavers and began customizing and designing Indian wear in collaboration with these talented crafts persons. In 2018, I decided to quit my job and finally pursue my calling of working with fabrics and designs. I started with a handful of sarees and showcased them at an exhibition in Delhi. The response was overwhelming, and many people called us with enquiries about the sarees. Unable to meet the demand and properly showcase the collection, I took a massive leap of faith, increased my collection, and rented a store in Greater Kailash, Delhi. Thus, Peeli Kothi was born.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques. Where did the inspiration for setting up a business come from?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> I have always had an inclination towards fashion and design, especially Indian couture. The saree trousseau in India is a tradition, an heirloom passed from generation to generation. Indian crafts are an art form. I see the Indian garment as a story, with its weavers, colourists, artisans, and master his (craftsmen) as the storytellers. As a child, I traveled extensively within India. Coming from a religious family, we visited temples where I witnessed the confluence of different cultures. The women visiting the temples mostly adorned sarees, which were not just local weaves but from across the country. I was fascinated. When I grew up and started traveling, I began collecting sarees from each state I visited. My love for travel and handloom were my biggest inspirations, and Peeli Kothi is the amalgamation of them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques.

When I decided to start my business, the transition wasn’t easy, as my formal education and training were in education and the sciences. With no background in business or retail, the first few months were spent navigating through challenges. I had to oversee sourcing, designing, operations, sales, and accounting. While delegation is key in business, you still have to overlook everything. As challenging as it was, I found this new chapter equally exciting.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques. Do you think women entrepreneurs support other women across the value chain of business? How have you impacted\/supported\/mentored the careers of other women?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> I strongly believe women across the value chain understand each other's struggles and aspirations and are the best allies. Nobody can understand the struggle of a woman better than another woman, no matter where they are in the value chain. I have had the privilege of working with some incredible women. Peeli Kothi works closely with women artisans across the country. We pledge 5% of our profits to contribute towards enabling women artisans in their businesses. As we grow, we intend to contribute more.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques.

I understand that with your own business, you can never really switch off, but do try to take out time for yourself. As an entrepreneur, you face setbacks every day. Give yourself and your business the time to get back on track. After all - Rome wasn’t built in a day!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

However, let's get practical; indeed, minimising your commute time may sound all good and well in theory, but in practice it is seldom that easy. Just wondering how much you let your commute influence whether to stay or leave a job. I'm not so much thinking about the length of the commute but also how you commute, whether the journey itself is pleasant\/safe or not, and if that's something you take in consideration when job hunting! Kavitha Ramachandragowda, is an entrepreneur who delved deeper into this topic, and leveraged the power of technology to revolutionize employee<br>transportation. A seasoned technology professional, Kavitha currently serves as the co-founder and executive director at Routematic, India’s leading Fleet Service and Transport Automation Software provider. She aims to set a benchmark for excellence in employee transportation and continue to innovate in ways that enhance the daily commute experience, ensuring safety, efficiency, and sustainability.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques. Tell us a little about your venture and your journey. How long ago did you start up? What has been your motivation and what do you aim to achieve?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> Routematic is a leading technology-driven urban mobility solution for daily office commute, focused on providing efficient and sustainable transportation solutions, serving in 21 cities for 200+ corporations across India with innovative technology and a comprehensive transport management system. Our venture started in the year 2013, with a vision to revolutionize employee transportation. At Routematic, we aim to set a benchmark for excellence in employee transportation and continue to innovate in ways that enhance the daily commute experience, ensuring safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Today, I can proudly say that Routematic has grown into a leading player in technology backed fleet services in India, with over 200 corporate clients across the country.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having been in the tech industry for over 17 years, my journey as a woman co-founder at Routematic has been both challenging and transformative. Throughout my career, I've taken on diverse roles, spanning software development, operations, finance &amp; HR. This multifaceted experience has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of the industry and the ability to drive our business forward. My journey underlines the importance of resilience, strategic thinking and effective communication in leadership. I take immense pride in contributing to positive change and remain dedicated to inspiring the next generation of leaders. And my motivation stems from a deep desire to create innovative solutions that address real-world problems, particularly in a sector that impacts the daily lives of countless employees. Being a woman myself, I am personally motivated more to provide a safe, secure and hassle-free transportation service for thousands of women employees across India, and thereby contribute positively towards empowering women in the workforce.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques. How easy or tough has it been for you, as a woman entrepreneur, to set up and promote your business?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> Navigating the tech and transportation sectors as a woman entrepreneur has not been without its challenges. Gender bias and stereotypes are prevalent in this male-dominated industry. To overcome these hurdles, I have consistently delivered high-quality work, built a supportive network, and honed my negotiation skills. Open communication about priorities has helped me manage work-life balance pressures, while advocating for inclusivity has driven positive change within the industry. Despite stereotypes, showcasing inclusive leadership styles has been key to my success.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques. How do you balance your professional and personal life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> Balancing the demands of the fast-paced tech industry with personal responsibilities requires effective time management, setting clear boundaries, and delegating tasks. Embracing technology and prioritizing self-care are also essential. I'm fortunate to have a supportive family and colleagues who understand the challenges I face and have been a constant pillar of support in my life.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques. Could you share some strategies or initiatives that organizations can implement to foster an inclusive workplace culture that encourages and supports the participation of women?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> According to a report by ILO, 52% of Indian women are keen to work in order to support their families, but they encounter several challenges such as lack of safe transportation and connectivity, balancing work and home, gender biases and lack of growth opportunities at work. As such, I believe it is imperative for businesses to establish and foster a suitable culture that can make the team feel empowered to truly tread the path to success. So, my suggestions would be as follows -<br>> Establish a culture of inclusivity and diversity.<br>> Ensure that women feel valued and appreciated.<br>> Empower women to pursue success.<br>> Provide mentorship and support networks.<br>> Promote open communication and feedback.<br>> Implement flexible work policies to support work-life balance.<br>> Recognize and address any gender biases in the workplace.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques. Do you have any tips for women entrepreneurs who are starting their journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> The technology landscape in our country is witnessing a powerful transformation as women carve their path, proving that brilliance, determination, and ambition knows no gender. My advice to aspiring female leaders is to believe in your capabilities and grab the boundless opportunities ahead. Establish clear limits, assign tasks strategically, give importance to both personal and professional well-being, and make sure you have a robust support network around you. The perseverance, fearless spirit, and drive, coupled with empathy, leadership, and communication skills that women naturally possess, will surely enable young women leaders to continue breaking barriers and thrive in their endeavours, leaving a lasting mark in the field of technology and innovation.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Furthermore, We at SheAtWork believe that such an industry becomes far more robust and rewarding when women step foot into it! To support this belief, today we have with us, Sunila Yadav, who aspires to provide end-to-end logistics solutions to a diverse customer base, through her venture, ‘Anil Mantra’. Holding a Masters degree in International Business, she ventured into the Cargo industry, which overwhelmed her by the sheer dynamics and problem-solving options.

Prior to this , though I was engaged gainfully in another employment, the urge to spread my wings, was irresistible. I was confident of my abilities and wanted to achieve some milestones that would have been impossible to achieve under the ‘employee umbrella’.

Entrepreneurship is never about a single destination – it is always about the journey one undertakes. It is unending! So, once you have reached the first goal, another one is generated automatically in front of you. Simply put, I achieved what I had aimed for when I started; now I aim to cover new milestones every 3-5 yrs.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ques-where-did-the-inspiration-for-setting-up-a-business-come-from\">Ques.

Prisha also means, a ‘Gift of God’. The company was formed in the loving memory of my mother, and it is my way of thanking her for her undying love and support.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With 23+ years of BFSI (Banking &amp; Financial Services Industry) experience, I have navigated my career through foreign banks, bank backed NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Company) and bank backed KPO (Knowledge Processing Centers).

Whether you are working in the corporate world or starting your entrepreneurial journey, you have to give it your 1000% ALL the time. Nothing comes easy, no matter how smart, hardworking, passionate and disciplined you are. It was a difficult decision for me to switch myself from a leadership position in a reputed foreign bank (letting go of 23+ years of reputation, goodwill, senior position, decent pay) to start my own company from scratch. As I kept deliberating this within me over months, the decision became easy one day. By January 2024, I was ready to lay the foundation of my company and leave behind a legacy of three decades. I had realized that I was at the right cusp of my career to take that entrepreneurial plunge – it was a ‘now or never’<br>situation. The biggest support for my decision obviously came from my family.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s been four months of having started this new journey and I have been consciously treading the path of work and more hard work.

It has been a conscious endeavor to empower women, and in the process, I have innovated and created platforms for them to deliver and shine. I have promoted meritocracy throughout, and have ensured safe working environment (free speech &amp; peace loving ecosystem) while simultaneously becoming a friend, facilitator and guide to my team members (both women and men), as and when required.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-has-the-support-of-friends-and-family-played-a-role-in-your-being-a-successful-entrepreneur-how-do-you-balance-your-professional-and-personal-life\">> How has the support of friends and family played a role in your being a successful entrepreneur?

So, learn from your failures and applaud yourself for your<br>achievements.”<\/em><\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. Why did you decide to take up entrepreneurship?&nbsp;<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. There was an urge to do something, a fire in the belly to roll out something that could serve the purpose of satisfaction and renumeration as well. I was eager to start a project, and discussed the same with my acquaintances\/friends, many a times. Sadly though, I never got an encouraging response. For me, trying to establish myself as a freelancer, seemed lucrative. Therefore, I tried my hands at teaching in an Engineering institute for almost eight years, and also supported my father in valuation of plant and machinery. However, the urge to actually feel the business ecosystem never left me. The turning point was when I was guided into<br>Management System auditing, which helped me to understand the nuances of businesses. This profession gave me an insight into challenges associated with the business and finding a solution for the same. It was then that I decided to start what could be an amalgamation of experience, expertise and demand. Therefore, along with my husband, I started launched ‘Aspiring Enterprises’. The domains of our company were tourism, management system consultancy and training in the same domain.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. What challenges did you face along the way?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. Challenges were perceived before I actually embarked on the journey as an entrepreneur, but some unforeseen roadblocks came once the execution started. As we know, tourism is the second largest industry in the world and we see lot of mushrooming in the market. This poses a tough competition on pricing which has to be matched with the markets. Further the shift in demand for domestic market where clients may or may not have preferences\/awareness about the quality being served to them, is yet another factor which makes it impossible to match the<br>prices. Deciding on strategies to meet the same is a challenge. However, our clarity on<br>‘no compromise on quality’ helped us to distinguish and find a place in the market.<br>Another challenge was that in consultancy, the businesses are little apprehensive<br>on strategic and core technology skills of the soft gender. To prove your mettle in<br>such eco system is challenging. However, patience, perseverance and<br>professionalism helped us in finding our space in such environments.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today the services that we provide are market driven and are measured qualitatively. So, had to be very clear about the quality of services and the value disposition to our clients. The word of mouth is equally important as marketing strategies. However, a clear vision always helps to prepare a roadmap. Whatever product or services that we choose to market, is aimed at providing benefit to the society. Rest, the operational level challenges are always there and are taken up wisely as and when they come.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. What has been your most crucial business&nbsp;decision? How has it helped you to evolve as an entrepreneur?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. Corona has brought about a paradigm shift in the operational aspects. When tourism was at its low, we looked for other options but never thought of parting from travel business. We strongly believed that it will pick up in the coming years. Also, ‘no compromise on quality of service’, was a judicious decision. In fact, we lost some business because of this, as the domestic market is price sensitive and less mature. Further, our objective of eco-tourism was another factor which was not completely understood by the clients. So, holding on such decisions was both, crucial and challenging.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, I believe, every challenge provides you with an opportunity to introspect, reflect and respond to the market and that’s when I also saw the evolution of holding on to our vision in spite of market strain.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. Where do you see yourself\/your brand in the future?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. We have a spectrum of client base, ranging from mid segment to high end, including corporates, groups and also solo travellers. With huge variation in the type of services that our industry demands we are trying to organically grow and have a footprint in the industry. Further, for other sector our focus is on working towards providing solutions to our clients in implementation of management system and getting the certifications. Our baby steps in the<br>direction of waste management is yet another step forward.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. What is that one piece of advice you would like to give other women, aspiring to become entrepreneurs?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans: I think the new generation is smart and clear about what they aspire for. My advice to them is to keep learning. Upskill yourself as per your requirement and execute the same. It is never too late to pursue your dream and have a new beginning at any age. Also, you are a role model both, at the personal and professional front. Learn from your failures and applaud yourself for your achievements. Have a strategy defined before jumping into action taking all<br>the risks into account. The rest will fall in place.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Despite my achievements as an Educationist, I sensed an invisible barrier limiting my true potential. My 19-year journey in education has been a roller coaster. Throughout my career, each parent and student interaction has been a source of inspiration. Through graphology, I witnessed their remarkable transformations and realized my calling extends beyond the classroom. This insight led to the creation of Selfwrite_Graphology Studio—an avenue dedicated to personal and professional growth through handwriting and fostering the right mindset.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ques-what-challenges-did-you-face-along-the-way\">Ques. What challenges did you face along the way?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. My journey started with lot of adventure, particularly when introducing a relatively lesser known service like graphology. General public has limited awareness about Graphology so educating potential clients about the benefits and legitimacy of graphology as a tool for personal and professional growth was the biggest challenge. We kept on doing Intensive Awareness programs for students, parents and professionals to give them hands-on knowledge. Establishing credibility and trust as a graphology expert took some time. Attracting clients and building a loyal customer base was another issue. Marketing graphology services is not easy due to its niche nature. In the digital age, there are software tools that claim to provide handwriting analysis. We need to differentiate their services by highlighting the human touch, personalized approach, and expertise we bring to the analysis.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ques-what-is-the-real-value-of-graphology-and-how-can-society-individuals-benefit-from-it\">Ques. What is the real value of graphology and how can society\/ individuals benefit from it?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. The real value of graphology lies in its potential to provide insights into an individual's personality, behaviour, and psychological traits through the analysis of handwriting. Graphology can help individuals gain a deeper understanding of themselves, uncovering hidden aspects of their personality, strengths, and potential areas for growth. This self-awareness can contribute to personal development and improved self-esteem. Graphology can provide insights into Relationship, Emotional Health, Conflict Resolution, Leadership Development, Parenting and Education, Wellness and Stress Management. Graphology is the backbone of forensic investigation too. Health threats like diabetes, hypertension, migraine, psychosomatic disorders, ENT, blood related issues can not only be investigated but can be controlled\/cured through Graphotherapy.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ques-where-do-you-aspire-to-be-10-years-down-the-line\">Ques.

What inspired you to develop your business idea?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. I have worked as a consultant at various positions in the Big 4 Accounting and consulting firms for about 22+ years before I started my own ventures. In these firms, I was finding it difficult to serve the clients holistically as the firms give very limited areas to consult-on in order to keep a divisional services structure. This not only hampers services but also quality services.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Further, there is a lot happening in India in manufacturing, skill development, mobility, etc, and I wanted to be a part of these New India initiatives in some way. In the Big 4 firms, it was not possible for me to handle consulting \/ advisory in these areas and various other prominent sectors in India.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, I decided to start a consulting firm for providing specialized services catering to their respective industry sectors apart from services in areas of regulations, taxation, accounting, finance etc. I decided to not just read through these industries but also to understand their pain and best areas.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Further, it gives me an opportunity to interact with Senior Management level and understand their business challenges and issues they face every day to grow in the New India initiatives.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. Knowing what you know now, is there anything you would have done differently when you were first starting out?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. Yes indeed. I should have first focused on educating the clients through the websites of our firms. This would improve the ‘preparedness’ before we delved into work processes. Since there isn’t sufficient time at later stages due to the abundance of work and involvement in the clients’ work, this would have been a wise move.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. What challenges did you have to overcome at the beginning of your journey?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. It was challenging to build up relevant teams across different service areas and search for the right talent-pool. I made a few mistakes while selecting team members considering their experience and exposure, but I realized it and made amends. With experience, I gauged that it is better to mentor and build up a young and energetic team who are not only willing to learn, and develop but are also interested in stepping out of their zone of expertise and work in different areas.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques.

Before starting any venture as an entrepreneur, it is essential to know your strengths and weaknesses and the plan should be made accordingly and thoroughly before starting any venture- economically and technically.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is always good to discuss your interest areas with your seniors and family members as they also know your strengths and weaknesses and can thus, guide you better.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most importantly, the venture or business that you choose should be of your interest and should be pursued with full focus, dedication, and perseverance. One must consider onboarding senior professionals, and mentors on the company board, for ensuring availability of unbiased expert advice and guidance.

      "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The irrefutable power of words has always been supreme but sometimes they do not express (for various reasons) what lies beneath. Here a graphologist’s role becomes essential in decoding what written words may not express completely. In tandem with this opinion, I believe, the most important responsibility a graphologist shoulders is to “listen” to the deeper message of the handwriting with an open mind and thereafter, comprehend it with clarity and empathy. This knowledge can further be put to good use – to reveal, educate, guide, heal or comfort people. Today, we have with us, Ishha Singh, a certified graphologist, handwriting and signature analyst, and certified Drawing and Doodle analyst, with more than 2 years of experience and over 90% accuracy in gauging what the hand-writing says.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-quote-graphology-is-one-of-the-most-effective-ways-to-comprehend-and-inculcate-changes-it-is-quick-and-effectual\">Quote – <em>\"Graphology is one of the most effective ways to comprehend and inculcate changes.

What is graphology all about?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. Graphology has a Latin origin, in which ‘Graph’ means to write and ‘logy’ means science. It is the scientific technique of analysing one’s handwriting to determine his or her character, strengths and weaknesses, inherent skills, qualities, behaviour, thought, process, self confidence, energy, fears, and insecurities.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. Why did you select it to write your career chart?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. It is very interesting to know that no two people have the same handwriting. Not even twins have the same handwriting. This is what fascinated me since my student life. Later I explored it further to find that Graphology is a science in itself. Since then, I knew that I want to work with people and for their betterment through handwriting analysis. For this, I pursued a professional course and learned from the renowned graphologists of the country.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Q3. Did you face any challenges while setting up your practice?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. Yes indeed, I did face many challenges. In fact, there were two major challenges before me. First was the task of getting people to trust benefits of Graphology, and secondly I had the feat of encouraging people to write using pen and paper, an art which unfortunately, has been usurped by gadgets. I had to conduct series of events including one to one interaction to explain to people about the importance of writing as it is best exercise for our brains. Also, through my analysis, I was able to gain the trust of people by making them aware of some surprising facts about them which were earlier unknown to them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. Do you see any special traits reflected in the handwriting of women entrepreneurs?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. There is no gender wise analysis of handwriting. As far as entrepreneurs are concerned, their handwriting reflects leadership qualities, courage, ability to say ‘no’, risk management, self esteem, straightforwardness and good decision-making ability.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. Where do you aspire to be 10 years down the line?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. Ten years is a very long time, and by then, I plan to transform atleast 10,000 lives through their handwriting analysis. I aspire to inform them about the changes they can make in their handwriting to gain H-R-C-M - health, relationship, career growth and money.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. Could you share some tips for other women who wish to follow in your foot-steps?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. Every woman, professional or home maker, should have basic knowledge of Graphology. This will help her take care of herself, her family and her profession in a much better way. I would love to help them in learning the basics of Graphology. For those who wish to pursue career as a Graphologist, I will suggest them to take up courses by experts.

It helps in striking a fine balance between the art and science of healthy living. In fact, if we peep into the benefits of yoga, they are numerous. It improves physical fitness, maintains general well-being, mental clarity and greater self-understanding as well! Apart from these when people actively seek to reduce the stress in their lives by consoling the mind, yoga has time and again been their go-to tool.

You are a communication specialist. What inspired you to embark on this fitness\/wellness journey?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. My journey towards wellness started as a process of my self-healing. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that one day I would take up Yoga as a profession. I would rather say that more than me choosing this path, Yoga chose me. I was suffering from certain gastronomical issues since few years, which finally got diagnosed as IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) in 2010. IBS is a chronic gastrointestinal ailment and mainly caused by erratic lifestyle, poor diet and sleep pattern and stress. Like any other lifestyle disease, unfortunately, there is hardly any long-term medical cure for this ailment and I somehow was trying to manage it through temporary medical reliefs. However, any stressful situation, whether work related or otherwise, would result in flaring up my IBS and make it more tough to deal with the task at hand. On top of it all, I was diagnosed with ovarian cysts twice between 2011-2015 and got it surgically removed both the times.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of it together started affecting my overall health as there was constant physical discomfort along with mental distress. That is when, a gynaecologist advised me to start practicing yoga and meditation as an alternative healing therapy and I started looking out for trainers specialising in therapeutic yoga. It was as if a sort of manifestation or divine intervention, one fine day, a friend of mine who was clueless about my ill health and my search for a yoga instructor, gifted me a book called Light on Yoga by BKS Iyengar (Guruji). After finishing the book, I was heavily inspired not only by Guruji’s scientific approach towards therapy yoga but also by his own life journey. In 1920’s during his own childhood, he had suffered from malnutrition, typhoid, malaria and TB. During his teenage years, he decided to learn yoga and with persistence and perseverance, he not only overcame his own sufferings but also became a worldwide exponent of yoga. He taught yoga until his death at the age of 95. In 2015\/16, I decided to take a sabbatical to focus on my health and forayed into yoga with the sole purpose of self-healing and improving my mental and physical wellness.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. Did you face any challenges while setting up your business?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Initially, it was never the intention to take up yoga as a profession, everything transpired organically. After a year of yoga practice, regulating my diet and being more mindful, there was significant improvement in my health. Gradually, friends and family started approaching me for tips &amp; sessions, of course free of cost, but that helped in enhancing my ability to teach and fuelled my confidence.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Around 2017, I started conducting classes at home for kids and female students with a minimal fee and our living room became my studio. In 2018, I decided to take up yoga as a full-time profession and partnered with Sumit Sapru, a senior Iyengar Yoga teacher &amp; joined Yogsattva. When we decided to expand, there were few challenges around the corner:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>> Studio within a budget: since most of the investments &amp; expenses were self-funded, it was really difficult to expand into a bigger studio space at a location of our choice within our budget. So, we decided to refurbished &amp; extend our existing studio, invested in yoga properties &amp; applicable technology.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>> Maintaining cash flow: when we started out, it took a little more time than usual for us to find a balance between maintaining a positive cash flow &amp; being socially responsible. Our idea was to make the community grow initially &amp; we had to negotiate on our operational side of business.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>> Offline marketing: it was a major challenge managing marketing the traditional way, we invested heavily on posters, pamphlets, brochures, merchandise etc. However, the response we received was not what we had hoped for.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. Have you noticed any changes in people’s attitude toward yoga and ayurveda from the time you started until now? <\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. When I started learning Yoga, I observed there was a modest divide in people’s attitude towards Yoga &amp; Ayurveda. There was one section of people who thought of it as aspirational but not accessible or workable, a practice which is difficult to follow and adopt as a regular wellness routine. Their thoughts were clouded with apprehensions such as, one needs to have a certain body type to practice yoga, should be flexible enough to do asanas or sit still for long hours to meditate, which is practically not possible. Similarly with regards to Ayurveda, they had opinions like following such a dietary plan or routine is not practical as it does not merge well with contemporary lifestyle.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then there was another section of people with completely opposing views thinking of Yoga as an alternate to other physical workout regimes. They considered yoga as a new &amp; upcoming trend to lose weight or tone muscles. Due to lack of awareness, they hardly realised that Yoga and Ayurveda is an approach or a process that one can adopt step by step. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Post pandemic, with consistent efforts and initiatives by the current Government and Ayush Ministry, people have gradually started realising the benefits of yoga and ayurveda, which is beyond just body.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are consistent with your practice, your body would definitely gain flexibility &amp; musculoskeletal strength &amp; you would be able to sit still for meditation. Our whole effort as teachers is to have a scientific &amp; focused approach to improve the overall quality of life, including healthier lifestyle, better physiological function, coupled with strong sense of mental clarity &amp; strength.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. What do you feel was the impact of the pandemic on the fitness and wellness arena? <\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. The pandemic and the consequent lockdown put a tremendous pressure on people’s physical and mental health. There was a sudden shift in the attitude of people towards health and wellness. They realised health is something beyond a fit body. It is much deeper, comprising of a healthy immune system, seamless breath work, functional vital organs and a balanced\/peaceful mind. Our traditional integrative system of Yoga and Ayurveda had a positive impact on collective well-being during the pandemic. Many people turned to yoga for a healthy body and a calm mind. Due to movement restrictions, we started conducting classes online for our existing students but to our surprise, lot of new students, some who had never ventured into yoga or ayurveda before, joined our sessions, pan India, and the US; and they are still continuing with the sessions.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. Where do you see yourself five years down the line?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. 5 years down the line, I would love to see myself continuing to teach yoga and simultaneously remain a student of Yoga for life. I would be still be learning &amp; evolving myself with the science of yoga &amp; ayurveda as it is such a deep rooted &amp; vast subject.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To be more specific, in the coming years, I would like to focus my energies towards the wellness of 2 sections of the society - women &amp; children. My aim is to create awareness to prioritize women’s healthcare, which generally gets neglected. Children are the building blocks of the future, and by introducing them to yoga from an early age, we can build a different generation altogether, who would be more persevered, disciplined &amp;focused.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yoga &amp; ayurveda are holistic science about human beings, I would also like to work towards building &amp; expanding our yoga community and share its knowledge, philosophy as well as functionality, vehemently.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. Can you share 5 yoga asanas which are an imperative for ensuring wellness of women, especially women entrepreneurs? <\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yoga is a blessing for women especially who are trying their best to keep up with their personal and professional commitments. It is imperative for women to have an integrative approach of practicing yogasana, meditation &amp; have a balanced diet. Few asanas that I would recommend for today’s women would be:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>> Suryanamaskar: Start your day with at least 6 rounds of Suryanamaskar, which not only is a great stretching &amp; warmup exercise but also helps you to maintain your energy levels throughout the day. Do remember, if you feel exhausted while doing it, stop &amp; lie down, regain your breath &amp; try doing it again.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>> Treepose or Vrikshasana: It is a balancing pose and will help you achieve stable mind &amp; body &amp; help in managing hormonal imbalance. Initially try to maintain the pose for 2-3 minutes &amp; you can take the support of a wall.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>> Child pose or Shishuasana: Child pose gives you an instant relief from stress and hence highly helpful to manage stressful conditions in personal or professional life. It is a beautiful calming pose that throws away all unwanted thoughts &amp; helps you focus on things that matter at the moment.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>> Butterfly pose or Badhkonasana: This pose does wonders for women suffering from any gynaecological condition &amp; improves the health of reproductive &amp; digestive organs. Even after long hours of standing or sitting, it releases tension from pelvic area, inner thighs &amp; knees.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>> Mindful breathing &amp; meditation: The practice of asanas should always be concluded with pranayama &amp; meditation. Beginners can either lie down or sit in a comfortable position &amp; be mindful of their breathing. By observing your breath, your nervous system will be calm and you will feel more composed.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is always advisable to practice yogasana in a calm &amp; quiet environment with a relaxed body and under the guidance of an instructor to maximize the benefits &amp; avoid injuries.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

The fifth World Food Safety Day (WFSD) being celebrated today, on 7 June 2023, like previous years, aims to once again draw attention to food standards. Food standards help us to ensure what we eat is safe. Along these lines WFSD inspires action to help prevent, detect and manage foodborne risks, contributing to food security, human health, economic prosperity, agricultural production, and so on.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On this day, it is but appropriate that I, Poonam Sinha, on behalf of Team SheAtWork engage in conversation with someone who caters to the gastronomical needs of the society. Her ‘goodies’ are a perfect blend of healthy and tasty! Today, here with us in conversation, is Nabanita Mukerjee, Founder of “Home Goodies”.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Quote – <em>“Maintaining hygiene and absolute cleanliness is non-negotiable and of utmost importance in the food business.”<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ques-what-inspired-you-to-embark-on-this-gastronomically-delightful-journey\">Ques. What inspired you to embark on this gastronomically delightful journey?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. My inspiration on this gastronomical journey is definitely my mother, who was exceptionally talented at cooking, my husband who encouraged me to bake, and my child who really appreciate and is my biggest critic for everything that I make or bake. In fact, my in-laws have played a pivotal role in helping me perfect my recipes with their honest feedback.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was in 2013 that I quit my full-time Public Relations job to learn how to manage a child, my dreams, and my home. I took some time off to figure things out. In the meantime, my husband observed my enthusiasm for cooking and encouraged me to bake. Besides, he also enjoys relishing baked desserts -so it was a win-win for both, I guess. It was then that I picked up my first convection microwave and started experimenting. I found immense happiness in baking and treating everyone around me.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My love for baking and cooking has only increased since then with each passing day. I must also mention the trust, support, and encouragement that I received from my friends on this journey.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Right from hosting and being sold out in my first baked goods exhibition at home to catering to orders my network of friends, colleagues and acquaintances have played a huge role.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. Did you face any challenges while setting up your business?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. As a baker or in any creative field the biggest challenge to start a business is to be consistent with your products and controlling the urge to experiment with every bake. Atleast for me, that was my biggest challenge to overcome. Since I enjoy baking or cooking a lot I have this constant urge to keep innovating with ingredients and techniques to create may be a new recipe or a new process\/way of doing something. Now that can indeed be extremely stressful, especially if you have a bulk order to cater to. It is with great difficulty, that I have managed to keep my order days and recipe experimenting days separate. I believe, that customers pay for the consistent taste of your food!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. What are the appropriate food safety measures that should be adopted by businesses?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maintaining hygiene and absolute cleanliness is non-negotiable and of utmost importance in the food business. Using high-quality raw materials and educating your customer about the ingredients that are going into the product is imperative, according to me. I also got my FSSAI registration done in 2020 and as a home-baker, I insist that my fellow bakers should also get it done. The FSSAI registration gives peace of mind to customers and also makes us more responsible &amp; committed to our business.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. Where do you see yourself five years down the line?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. I have been baking professionally for close to 6 years now. However, it started off as my moonlighting endeavour. My full-time baking experience has been since 2021 and honestly it’s the most gratified I have ever felt working. Besides the fact that I would love to do this till time, health and resources permit, I also aspire to build my own quaint café in Pune and then maybe a few more. I would also like to publish my recipe book with all the experiments that I have done and noted. I believe in taking one step at a time and calculated ones as well – so, I plan to continue doing what I am currently engaged with for a few more years, before I take my next step.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ques. Any tips for women aspiring to follow in your footsteps?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. The most important tip that I would surely like to give is that women aspirants should never adopt haste. I have observed that nowadays people seem to be in a hurry to achieve everything that they aspire for in a short period of time. However, I think the game is not about the pace but more about consistency which helps you achieve accuracy. Even though it might take you longer, but it surely will make you the best at what you do!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

The purpose of life is not solely to be happy, but to be useful and productive toward your surroundings as well. Today, I, Poonam Sinha from Team SheAtWork, have the pleasure of meeting one such person who nurtures a genuine belief of giving back to the society – Dr. Priyanka Anuj Sidharth. A Dental Surgeon by profession, she also holds a Diploma in Implantology and Cosmetology. Her vast experience is reflected in her work and her compassion towards people finds a vent in the clinic run by her. The clinic in Jungpura, works on the concept of ‘paying back to the society’ where she strives to provide the best treatment to all people of society at charitable rates.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Quote – <em>“With the money I earn, I don’t wish to raise my standard of living; I wish to raise my standard of giving!”<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 id=\"h-ques-what-prompted-you-to-choose-your-area-of-work\">Ques. What prompted you to choose your area of work?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. Since my school days I always wanted to be a health line worker and serve humanity. Because I was a good student and scholarship holder , my teachers, friends and parents insisted that I pursue science. This I believe, motivated to become a doctor.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Ques. You firmly believe in paying back to society, what sparked this noble thought and endeavour?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. I believe someone has to become a role model to encourage others to follow the path of doing good. Medical profession is considered to be a very noble profession – and rightly so! Growing up, I often pondered about the purpose of my life and was propelled by the thought of helping everyone survive and thrive in the world. I believe, this thought is what makes me human. Fortunately, my family members always supported my thoughts – in fact, it is majorly because of their support that I am where I am today, doing what I like to do the best – pay back to the society with good deeds!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Ques. Did you face any challenges while setting up your clinic?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. I have always been up for challenges and I try to turn them into opportunities. From the beginning, I was determined to do everything from scratch, without any professional help. Whether it be designing, installation or placing fixtures, I inspected everything!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Work is worship for me and this clinic is my place of worship. From a financial point of view, I was fortunate to get this place where I was not liable to pay any rent and I had full liberty to work at charitable rates, as the trustees of the premises are like-minded people. Though I received a lot of opposition from some people because I was providing good quality of work at low cost, that didn’t stop me from moving ahead. So far, I have never compromised on the quality of material\/work\/services provided and I intend continuing to do so in the future as well. We technically work on “No profit” but whatever little profits I do rake in, it is invested back in buying better technology to serve the society even better.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Ques. What do you aspire to achieve in next few years?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. I aspire to buy all latest technology available in the market to provide all kinds of facilities to people who can’t afford it. I believe money constraints should not deprive people of the best available medical facilities. I cater to patients from all strata of society – and this empowers me immensely.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I remember doing root canal treatment of a rickshaw puller; he would pay me in currency notes of 10s-20s . Whatever he earned in a few hours, he would bring it to me for his treatment. Finally, I decided to treat him free of cost! Again, there have been many cases where I provided prosthesis on laboratory costs. By doing all of this, I wish to spread more goodwill amongst people, encouraging them to do good as well!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Ques. What would you advise youngsters aspiring to build career in cosmetology and implantology?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. I think both are emerging fields, cosmetology is in vogue. Today, people are more conscious about their looks and skin care regimes. Resultantly, markets are flooded with many therapies that enhance the collagen and elastin build up – you simply need to pick the right one for yourself. Implantology is not new in dentistry, it’s just that lately people are paying more heed to it. They know what is good for them and with new advancements dentistry is almost painless.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, with these raging trends in place, I would advise youngsters to make the jump – you will succeed.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

      "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>“Disability need not be an obstacle to success.” – Stephen Hawking<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Studies suggest that increasing the status and social and economic participation of people with disabilities does have positive effects on the society and nation alike. In fact, personally, I believe that disability is simply a state of mind- it is a part of the person, not the whole person! There have been people who, with a little support, have not let their disability hold them back them in any way. Today, on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities 2022, I, Poonam Sinha, have the honour of interacting with Ms. Neena Wagh, Founder of A.L.A.P. – (Assisted Living for Autistic Persons) – who strives to empower children with special needs and endows them with the courage and means to live a respectable life. A.L.A.P. is a second-home to children with special needs, which has a free - flowing environment devoid of strict regulations.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Quote- “Parents of special needs children are plagued with the “ what after us” question all their lives. ALAP was setup to answer it!”<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques 1. What inspired you to tread the path of enabling and empowering?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I believe, the starting point for me was the birth of my son, Ammogh, who was diagnosed with Autism when he was all of two and a half years old. Caring for him brought about an awakening in me – I learnt to look beyond myself towards the needs of other parents with special needs children. Parents of special need children are plagued with the “ what after us” question all their lives. But no one seems to have the answer! My search for this answer led me to Dehradun, where I found a second-home-like set up for Ammogh, where he learnt to be independent while performing a number of daily tasks. From there, my mind conceived the idea of A.L.A.P. – a place where children would be cared for, loved unconditionally and taught skills to help them overcome routine challenges. I wished to create a set-up which would replicate home for them. So, I would say, my son inspired me to tread this path of enabling and empowering children with special needs. I knew it was time to rise another rung to become a provider from simply being a parent.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Presently, our aim is to provide lifelong care and create an environment wherein all the opportunities will be available for a young adult with Autism to learn and live with as much independence as he can with minimum assistance. We also aspire to promote an understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights and well-being of persons with disabilities. Moreover, along with working on the ADL (activities of daily living) of these young adults, we also try to skill them according to their capabilities and interests. Moving forward, we are trying to loop in organizations who can employ these young adults and grant them financial stability as well.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques 2. What challenges did you face in this journey? How did you overcome them?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A.L.A.P did not happen overnight; it was a long journey before A.L.A.P came into being. Locating and bringing together people with the same thought-processes and sensibilities was indeed a challenge. Either we need to find the right set of people to support us or we can simply adopt the idea of ‘ekla cholo re’ (walk ahead alone). In my case my husband was a great source of support and we decided to take on this journey. Once the course is set, people begin following. So now, I have overcome these challenges.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Again, one cannot expect to voice their vision and expect someone else to translate it into reality – this belief has led me to walk the talk! Once I gained clarity about my vision and knew what I wanted to do, there was no looking back. I began practicing what I preached – from planning as to what the organization should look like, what it must cater to, to who can be a part of this second home as my support system- I have been there – done it all!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques 3. How important is it to sensitize staff members? What measures are taken in this direction?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Staff members are the backbone of every organization. They are indeed extensions of your vision – they reflect what you aspire to do. Hence, in my case, I believe, sensitizing staff members towards children with special needs is of utmost importance. Caring for children with Autism can be extremely demanding – my staff members have been trained to portray the kind of patience where they would never tire as care-givers. Since I have strived towards seamless capacity building in staff members, encouraging them to nurture the ‘never back out’ attitude in themselves, I believe I too need to reflect this attitude through my efforts. I wish to lead by example – thus, I try to put in my best as a care-giver, as a capacity builder and become the role model my staff members should follow.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques 4. Where do you see yourself 10 years down the line?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I see myself happily retired 10 years down the line! For next five years I will be working actively to stabilize this organization and reach many more milestones. Currently we have just finished the first leg of our journey – there is so much more to do, so much more to give! Moving ahead, after five years, I intend to look for people who can take over from me and run the place with passion and love. I will in the meantime always be a part of A.L.A.P. but in a more passive role. In those years I want to engage myself more in community outreach programs. Currently, also, I am mentoring a parent group from different cities who wish to set up help, awareness and skilling systems for children with special needs. I also have a Facebook page<br>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/1673856092897222\/?ref=share_group_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/1673856092897222\/?ref=share_group_link<\/a>) where I collate and share information about issues pertaining to care-giving for Autistic children. I talk to parents; there are series of interviews which allow a very realistic glimpse into the lives of special needs children and people associated with them. While I am securing my son, I wish to do the same for other special needs children as well!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ques 5. That one piece of advice you would give other women who wish to follow your footsteps?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Women are natural nurturers. They are a source of soft strength. If you hope to leave the world feeling that your child will still be cared for, remember to do the same - care for other children as well. Nurture your ability to care, love unconditionally and put it to good use.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Today, I, Poonam Sinha from SheAtWork have the privilege of interacting with one such artist, Priti Karn, who believes that the first step to controlling your world is to keep your culture unharmed. Through her paintings, she, models and demonstrates the kind of world she demands to live in. In Priti’s family, Madhubani is a family heritage that’s been passed down the generations; her skills were honed by her Guru and Grandmother, Padma Shri Shilp Guru, Smt. Godawari Dutta.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em><strong>Quote - Madhubani art is a conventional folk art that is still thriving….and so it shall be<br>forever!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6><strong>Ques 1. What drew you towards traditional folk art? Who or what has been your inspiration?<\/strong><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Padma Shri recipient Smt. Godawari Dutta, is my grandmother and so I can rightly say that art was embedded in my DNA! As a child, I became interested in the Madhubani art form and I hardly realised when this interest turned into my passion. My grandmother inspired me to perfect my skills and I left no stone unturned to express and connect with people through my art.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Ques 2. How do you market your work and what challenges do you face in the process?<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I put up my art pieces for sale in my workplace and also through exhibitions. Although I believe in ‘art for art’s sake’, the commercial aspect is important too. Getting a place perfect for an art exhibition and then advertising it, are indeed a difficult task. I put up exhibitions two- three times in a year and I go through this challenge every time. Fortunately, now, technology has become an enabler of many difficult tasks, so we have decided to market our pieces online as well.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Ques 3. What according to you, is the role of an artist in society and how do you fulfill the same?<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I believe that the artist indeed has the lofty role of pushing out dominant narratives in the society. Art is an effort to create, beside the real world, a more humane world and artists can shoulder this responsibility well. Sometimes art can speak out loud what humans may not be able to voice for various reasons. Also, art can be a great way to keep people updated. For example, I have painted pieces about the pandemic and its effects and have also addressed the Russia-Ukraine war in some pieces.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Ques 4. What would you advise other women who wish to take up art as a source of career<br>development?<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I believe that every calling is great when greatly pursued! So, if you are passionate about art, art be it! During the pandemic, I have had the good fortune of teaching the Madhubani art style to 500 aspiring artists online. I think, the first step to controlling your world is to control your culture. So, model and demonstrate the kind of world you demand to live in. So go ahead and write the books, make music, shoot films, paint art……..<br>However, be patient as the commercial fulfilment through art trickles in gradually.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Ques 5. What are your future plans?<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I plan to go on teaching the art of Madhubani paintings to many more aspiring artists in the future. My aim would be to help them grow, both, personally as well as professionally. Interestingly, even the gender barrier has collapsed today and we can see quite a few male artists practicing Madhubani style painting. I am already a State Government (Bihar) awardee, and I aspire to win a National Award someday by contributing to the society through my art.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Her hard work, humility and honour, has made her the woman that she is today! She talks to POONAM SINHA, about her journey, which has been difficult yet satisfying, and the satisfaction is what she holds onto.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q1. How difficult was it for you to start off? How did you think about becoming an entrepreneur?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I began working, the circumstances were completely different than the present day. A woman entrepreneur in those days, faced innumerable challenges and had to swim against the tide; there was no respect for a lady who wished to do anything which didn’t adhere to the set societal norms. There was a glaring disparity between the rights of men and women, which made me uncomfortable and at time agonized. Yet, this did not deter me. I knew that in creating an identity for myself, I was enabling other women as well. I had a point to prove - that women were and are capable of taking up challenges and accomplishing whatever they are passionate about. Perhaps this thought propelled me towards becoming an entrepreneur.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q2.What do you think are some strengths that a woman entrepreneur should possess?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Devi Durga is considered as the feminine epitome of strength. I believe that in every woman there resides a Durga as well. Awakening the Durga in every woman will give her the power, wisdom, determination and confidence to pursue what she wishes to…even entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>.<strong>Q3. Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I wished to start my own business but I did not know how to bring my ideas to a consequence. Being inexperienced only added to my challenges and my confidence level too was abysmally low. These and additionally, the negative attitude of people all sum up the challenges I faced. I must say, it was an uphill journey.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q4. What was the support you received from family and friends?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My family's support and belief in my abilities formed the backbone of my entrepreneurial endeavours. They gave me space and let me live my life without any compulsions from their end.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q5. How did you try to build and motivate your team, and make your business different?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I believe that entrepreneurship can be a 'one person idea input' but the final output is always a team effort. Considering this, it is extremely important that teams are always motivated and comfortable in the work environment at the same time. I always try to build cordial relations with my team members and value their hard work and skills. Building trust is very important to make your business successful. My team knows that whenever they are in pain, I will stand by their side and this I think will stand me in good stead and make my business different.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q6. Any tips you would like to share with women, who are thinking of becoming independent and starting their own business?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Personally I feel, women have more intelligence than men. However, a major drawback is that women lack courage; this is an obstacle they have to learn to overcome. Today and every day, I wish to encourage women &nbsp;to &nbsp;be brave, charge ahead and conquer the world!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q7. What are your future plans?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My future plan is to work with rural women and promote the arts and crafts of Bihar. The purpose is twofold - keeping our culture alive in the forms of various arts and crafts and also helping rural women to step out and become 'Atma Nirbhar'. I pray to God, to give me the strength to fulfill my dream.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q8. How do you achieve a work-life balance today?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It depends on your management skills how well you balance your personal and professional life. If you are determined and passionate about your work, nothing can stop you. Amazingly, you will find eventually, everything falling into place. Valuing your family, friends and work equally, will complete the circle.&nbsp; This is how I have achieved a work-life balance today.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Thus, one of the key ways to help improve female representation in the entrepreneurial world is to unlock access to mentors for women. Having a professional mentor gives a woman the opportunity to develop professionally with the guidance of a dedicated ally; and today, I, Poonam Sinha, have the opportunity to speak with one such mentor, who has set out to offer her experience and insight to women entrepreneurs, guiding them as their careers progress. Amrit Ahuja is business and communications global executive with over 26 years of experience, who in 2019 crossed over to lead her life with a ‘Purpose’. Today Amrit consults brands in the social sector and mentors upcoming women leaders.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Quote - <em>Entrepreneurial development has ignited the process of progress worldwide, making it one of the most significant factors contributing to the economic growth of a country. In tandem with this, I believe, women entrepreneurs can be the back bone of the Indian economy.<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Ques 1. What allured you into the direction of mentoring women entrepreneurs?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I believe, women entrepreneurs can be the back bone of the Indian economy.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) report stated that $12 trillion could be added to global GDP by 2025 by advancing women’s equality.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As per McKinsey, India could add up to $770 billion—more than 18%—to its GDP by 2025, simply by giving equal opportunities to women.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Currently, India has the lowest share of women’s contribution (17 percent) to GDP than the global average of 37 percent. ( Chinese women contribute 41 percent, Sub-Sahara Africa 39 percent and Latin American 33 percent).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hence to reduce this gap, and considering that women entrepreneurs in turn can create more jobs for women, I felt it was essential to create a gender equal world. So, I decided to start with the source and mentor women entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Ques 2. How Important is mentorship for women entrepreneurs in your opinion?<br><\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Women naturally do not create business networks as they rush home immediately after completing work at office, to attend to family. This is a big set-back for women. Also, we all need a bouncing board and someone who has your back at all given times. Not just women entrepreneurs, but every working professional must have a speed dial of mentors. These are people who you can reach out to when working to solve a professional or a personal problem. Again, the journey of entrepreneurship is a lonely one so, I always encourage people to find a diverse set of mentors who can be your guiding light.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Ques 3. What are the biggest challenges you face as a mentor of future women leaders?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The biggest challenge I face is the frustration that women leaders face when navigating any corporate structure. Most organisations are designed with a \"man\" in the head and although some are beginning to change, we still have a long way to go, before the industry begins capturing details through a ‘women first lens’ in leadership or board position. Policies are designed to grow women within the organisation but the problem starts at the hiring stage. Data shows that it takes Rs.5000 to hire a woman and Rs.2,500 to hire a man. The difference is in keeping women costs accounted for \"period leaves\" or a pregnancy in the first 3 years of hiring. Looking at this data many women do not get hired at the entry level. Hence the problem takes roots right at the entry level! Appropriate policy and advocacy are needed to bridge the hiring gap and then grown on from there.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is alarming that female labour participation in India has hovered between 20 - 26% since 2006, and stands below countries like Bangladesh (35%) and Sri Lanka (31%)! This has happened despite rising education levels, increasing visibility of women in corporate jobs and progressive amendments like the Maternity Benefit Act in 2017. So, clearly data shows that we need some big changes to get more women into work and help women leaders to fulfil their roles as representatives of organisations.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Ques 4.

      "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The past two years have brought the importance of mental well-being into the limelight, albeit under unfortunate circumstances. Today, mental health has become an important part of the public conversation, as many Olympic athletes, celebrities, and other public figures have come forward to openly talk about their mental health issues to help reduce the stigma often associated with it. As we enter the pandemic-generated new era, we can expect mental health to continue to be a top priority in the coming years particularly as the world reckons with a growing mental health crisis. Along these lines, I, Poonam Sinha from Sheatwork, have the privilege of conversing with Priyanka MB, Founder- of ‘Inspiron’ a Psychological Well-Being Centre. She is a Social Entrepreneur and Psychologist, working towards providing quality mental healthcare. She aspires to transform emotional wellness through scientific and solution driven models that de-stigmatize seeking support and making it more accessible and affordable for people at large.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><br><em><strong>Quote - 'It's not about how far you go, it's about how many people you take along with you through this journey- Transforming mental healthcare delivery.'<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><br>Q1. What encouraged you to embark on the entrepreneurial journey?<br><\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>‘One to one’ or ‘One to many’? An important question I have often pondered over. In the healthcare industry, the challenges are endless, while alongside, the rewards of recovery and healing of your patients, is highly noble and satisfactory.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My vision became stronger when I recognized and identified the lacuna in the mental healthcare field. Starting from the stigma, lack of awareness, ignorance, dearth of mental health professionals and poor quality of delivery, this nascent field required rewiring of the system and in the minds of people.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Personally, I realised that an individual, can alone not bridge the requirements of the field. Statistics and research stated that the availability of a psychiatrist to patient ratio was 1 :400000 and 1 in every 4 individuals experienced depression or anxiety in one or the other point of time in their life. Of them, 85% , did not seek treatment for various causes such as lack of availability of services or awareness of treatment options.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Interestingly enough, my inclination towards social entrepreneurship was duly supported by my mentors, teachers, family and friends. Change, Transformation and Growth was my goal from as early as when I was 16 years of age. Growing up, I saw my parents ‘do their dues’ to society, and I picked up on their teachings.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Learning through the years, I knew we had to build a system to address the concerns faced in our industry. Therefore, Inspiron, is built on the premise to improve delivery of mental healthcare, while making the services affordable and accessible. Intensive research, experimentation, risk taking and learning led to the start of my entrepreneurial journey. We as an organization, started with conducting free sessions, to test the market and build our prototype.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Typically, we started at a garage, moved to a Café and then set up our first centre in 2017 in Indiranagar, Bangalore.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><br>Q2. What according to you, are some strengths that women entrepreneurs must possess?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>‘Keep moving forward and you will see, the marks you’ve left behind'.<\/em> Resilience is the key to<br>achieving the vision, you set for yourself.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On a personal note, I believe that leadership, passion, perseverance, empathy, and enhancing the zest to keep learning, are traits which will take you far in your journey. I also believe, that having a growth mindset, along with creative and logical thinking, and the ability to make informed choices while having the resilience to take risks are important in the field of entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it comes to your venture, ensure that you connect to your consumers’ needs, and convert what you have in front of you to build marketplace opportunities.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Q3. Very often we witness a stigma latched onto the concept of seeking mental health support. How have you&nbsp;de-stigmatized it?&nbsp;<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I always learnt that, ‘If you want to make a change, make it BIG’. Making it big means touching upon more lives. As an entrepreneur, I started on a very small scale, typically from a garage space. While I paddled into understanding the needs and requirements of the industry, I recognized that de- stigmatizing mental healthcare could begin with providing warm and safe spaces such as a café-like environment to patients.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We set up our first café-based experience to test the waters, becoming the country’s first psychological wellbeing centre. And over a period of a year’s time, we saw that people were more open to walking into a café- based setting rather than a hospital setting. This led to our concept “Consultation Over Coffee” taking wings. We saw that clients were able to express themselves more when it was made easy for them, through a warm setting, and a convenient place to be able to just be themselves.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our second approach was to use more creative forms of therapy, like art, dance, music, and animal-assisted therapy to foster and enable expression which leads to healing. A combination of standardized and scientific tools leads to the culmination of the best use of psychiatric practices by our team of mental health professionals who are certified and qualified in the field.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Third, for better reach and accessibility we introduced digital mental health kits for self-care. In this manner, we were able to provide services for all severities of mental health. From stress, depression, and anxiety to severe psychiatric conditions.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We began to advocate the importance of mental healthcare through more awareness programs and campaigns. We also streamlined our services to cater to our target population: the general public, corporate enterprises, and educational institutions.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Q4. Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you in the process?<br><\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a practitioner who was just starting out with a venture,&nbsp;I, too, was faced with the obvious challenges of getting more funding opportunities to scale, and find a team and co-founders to work towards the vision.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The pandemic helped in building more awareness about mental health, however, it did pose a challenge to pursue in-person sessions for a certain period which did impact the business model.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Q5. Where do you see yourself 10 years&nbsp;down the line?<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 10 years, I want to see Inspiron, as a global brand for Mental healthcare partnerships and services. Advocacy and intervention are the most important verticals of the business. Scaling with more hospitals and clinics, and wellness spaces will be the priority, while parallelly we will hold a strong base in the digital market place with AI based solutions, robotics, tele-medicine etc.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We will be the one stop solution in the Mental health space with educational institutions, research labs and regulatory boards for standardized treatment delivery as well. We aim to provide mental healthcare first aid kit to every household, in order to build happier and healthier homes.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also see myself being a board of the highest delegate for mental health advocacy, changing policies, administrations, regulatory boards, setting up educational institutions that facilitate learning, internships, training, exposure, research and technology in the field.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Q6. What advice would you give to budding women entrepreneurs, especially those aspiring to venture into the mental wellness zone?&nbsp;<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To all the women entrepreneurs in my field and otherwise, I would like to say ‘Believe in yourself’. Stay close to your ‘Why’, and build an attitude of the ‘Growth mindset’. Remember your passion, that led you to embark this journey of entrepreneurship, meanwhile, also build a support system that will help as a crutch during rough stages.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>‘Stay relevant’- which means you need to understand your marketplace opportunities. Women are known to be great communicators, use that to connect with people and achieve your goals. Gain clarity, build confidence and communicate effectively.&nbsp;Know your business verticals, be versatile. Focus on all areas that influence your business growth, that includes finance, accounting, administration, operations, research and development, Human Resource Development, and marketing and sales models.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most importantly, keep reminding yourself about your goal. Hold on to it, and believe in yourself. Increase the scope for people to see you as an aspirant and achiever of success, rather than a follower. Finally,&nbsp;‘keep moving on’, know that a business runs with leadership, your team and consumers. Know when to prioritize and never lose sight of the vision.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

However, my interest in entrepreneurial ventures has been a decade old. From the start of my career as a branding professional I was always interested in doing things out of the box and taking new initiatives. At times it was greatly appreciated by my seniors and at other times I was advised to slow down. That's how I learned the nuances of the trade and discovered I enjoyed it. It took me a few years to put everything together, do a lot of consulting projects, learn more, cultivate a good network and when I felt I was ready, I started my venture.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-q2-what-are-some-strengths-that-women-entrepreneurs-aspiring-to-achieve-must-possess\">Q2.

I enjoy reading a lot and also write a lot of research papers. Now I face a lot of time constraints for the same. I try to take care of my mother and family as much as possible but my work keeps me out of home most of the time. Sometimes I want to spend more time with her and focus on my hobby (painting) but don't get as much time now. However, I am blessed with a very supportive family and a group of very helpful friends, who have helped me manoeuvre the busy meanders of my entrepreneurial and personal journey.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The consulting business is tough as global clients work in different time zones and operate under different laws.

Considering your sports background (as you were a national level badminton player), what inspired you to become an entrepreneur in this space?<\/strong><br><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Growing up with a background in sports, I’ve always held sports close to my heart. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 2019, with both my children settled in their respective careers, I was looking to take up an assignment that brought in a sense of fulfilment. That’s when I was approached to be the founder-CEO of Dhanuka Dhunseri Soumyadeep Poulomi Table Tennis Academy.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And, I immediately realised that this was the right opportunity and the right time to pursue my true passion. So, when the opportunity presented itself, I was excited to be involved in the training of youngsters in table tennis.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As the CEO of the Academy, I am focused on nurturing and guiding these youngsters all the way to winning laurels for the country. I am sure that the day will come very soon.<br><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q2. How did you try to fine-tune your Academy so that it delivers differently?<\/strong><br><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having raised a child who went on to earn an international ranking in tennis, I saw from close quarters how important it was for the student, parent and coach to work as a team to achieve the desired results.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That experience made me realise there are three key stakeholders – the student, the parents and the coach – in the ecosystem. I felt I could achieve my goals only if I was able to provide the finest coaches in the best environment, inspire the student to work hard, and also manage the parents’ expectations.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Indeed, taking a holistic view of the goals of each student is the key to what differentiates our Academy from the others operating in West Bengal and even the rest of the country.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q3. Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There have been many challenges. The quality of table tennis in Bengal has been traditionally among the best in the country, until recently, when other states started to overtake Bengal. This was mainly owing to the fact that there wasn’t much advancement in Bengal – both in terms of coaching methods as well as facilities.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, funds were lacking to promote players to participate in tournaments nationally and internationally to improve their levels. Being a new academy in this space, it wasn’t easy breaking into this already crowded space with my new ideas.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The mindset of parents is another challenge that I often struggle with. Sometimes their expectations are unrealistic and other times it’s a challenge to convince them that their children need to focus on only one sport and devote the required time to it, if they are to realize their potential.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Upgrading the levels of the coaches constantly is another issue that keeps me busy as it’s not only their technical acumen that needs to be periodically updated but also their soft skills in being the most effective coach to the students.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, the most important challenge of all—inspiring the students to work hard and achieve their potential. For that, I have to constantly keep myself motivated enough to serve as an effective mentor to each student.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q4. How do you deal with competition in your chosen field?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To be frank, I haven’t found much competition in any table tennis academy as our philosophy and goals are very different vis-à-vis the other academies in Kolkata\/West Bengal.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q5. What are some strengths that a woman entrepreneur should possess?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All entrepreneurs – irrespective of gender – should possess what I call the three-way method to success. These are Passion, Knowledge, and Implementation. These qualities are dynamic and need constant updating.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q6. What are your future plans?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My future plans for the Academy are to move to a larger, better facility with a gym, cafeteria, and housing so that our students can truly pursue their dreams of one day winning gold for the country.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q7.

It’s all about bringing authenticity to your fingertips! Srishti Raai along with the Bollywood diva Sonakshi Sinha has founded a one of a kind, premium press-on nail brand - SOEZI, with the vision to create chic, long lasting, damage and cruelty free press-on nail brand. In a dialogue with Shree Lahiri, she speaks about the evolving nail industry in India, the challenges faced, the competition, future plans and more….<br><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q1. How did you think about becoming an entreprene<strong>ur and how did you focus on nail art?<\/strong><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Growing up, I have been surrounded by first generation entrepreneurs and this made me<br>realize how exciting and thrilling entrepreneurship could be. With this exposure, I focused on business and law as a degree and that furthered my fervor for all things business. I am aware of how lucky I am to be living in times where so much is possible in innovation when it comes to products and markets. I have constantly been on the lookout for gaps in the market, needs that are unserved that might be opportunities for business. As a devout to “great nails” and fashion in general, I was facing troubles in constantly going to nail salons with my busy schedule. The pandemic further heightened the need for innovation in this sphere. Sonakshi and I both felt the pain and had a common dream about defining the space!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q2. What are some strengths that a woman entrepreneur should possess?<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Women entrepreneurs in mindsets need to embrace and embody our natural strengths. More specifically in India, we need to have bold visions, build the ability for consistent action, use our grit through the ups and downs (there will be tons of downs and hiccups) and mostly be focused on your goals, your mission and your people. The new strength I have realized and embraced is collaborating, supporting, cheering for and partnering up with other women (and\/or men) who share your values and vision.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q3. Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you?<br><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is a competitive market, our biggest challenge was going for excellence and high quality and managing pricing and value that our customers pay. Launching a product business is not easy, there is so much paperwork and logistics we have to manage, navigate constant fires across manufacturing, recruitment, legal, marketing. We conceptualized, designed, tested our business during the peaks of the pandemic so that was definitely a very big challenge - not being able to meet our users for testing, setting up a unit, doing big campaign shoots with restrictions was definitely one for the books!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q4. How is competition in your business area?<br><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>India is a big market (the 4th globally) for generating the highest revenue from the beauty and personal care market. We have big players like P&amp;G, L’oreal dominating the market, but the great part is we now see so many homegrown brands really coming to the fore with successful products and business models. The market is projected to grow to USD 33 billion in the next 5 years. We are also seeing homegrown brands by celebrities and influencers more than we have ever seen in the past. There is so much going on both on the supply and demand side, it is truly a great time to be in this market and create a dent.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q5. How did you try to make your business different?<br><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is simple in principle, but was hard to execute - we focused on a gap in the market, we unearthed a need and challenge that users of nail-related products face. Once you find that sweet spot, your solutions will be different. Typically, users when it comes to cosmetics and beauty products are torn between quality, price, and feasibility. If it’s easy, it’s not durable. If it’s high quality it’s not easy on your pockets. If it’s easy on your pockets it’s probably not your best bet either. You either put on nail paint (which is hard), go through the time and cost of nail treatments or not do anything because it’s… hard! So we wanted to differentiate by being easy, democratized and really high quality.We wanted to not just create a product but a full experience that empowers you, reduces hassle and makes you feel glamorous (be a great return on your investment in all ways).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q6. What are your future plans?<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We want to stay deep rooted and informed by the needs of our users - women, girls, men, others and constantly innovate and create to make beauty SOEZI (so easy). Maybe soon our customer needs and the market will take us further than nails, but for now we are here to nail our press-on &amp; nail focused game.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q7. Any tips for someone starting out today?<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Entrepreneurship can not be taught, it’s only through action. If you want to start- start! Be bold, be smart (start small) but start and embody the entrepreneurial mindset - we go big, we take risks, we see things differently and we create.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

However, the crevices in the ecosystem are perceived by the optimistic lot as opportunities; to fill the gaps and curate an equal society. Youth are the embodiment of such optimism. Bubbling with positive force, they can yield unmatched development, and today, Team Sheatwork, has the pleasure of engaging in conversation with one such young mind – Tarini<br>Malhotra, who aims to bring about the needed change through noble social initiatives.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>\"There are no boundaries beyond those we create in our minds! I believe that I can change lives and am working towards that.\"<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q1. How did you think of starting off on your own at such a young age? What was your inspiration?<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From a very early age, I've been encouraged to think about how we can improve the lives of the marginalized, and contribute to creating a sustainable change in society. When COVID-19 disrupted our world, people from all over the globe came together to support each other during turbulent times, and we witnessed soaring levels of compassion. This proved that we humans are sensitive and capable of more than we believe and together, we can create a just, diverse, inclusive, and conscious society. This inspired me to try and work towards addressing the challenges our society is facing, and I started Project Nishant to provide employment opportunities to neurodiverse people. Over the past year, Project Nishant has taken wings and proved that there are no boundaries beyond those we create in our minds. The success of this project further inspired me to take the next step and expand the scope and impact of our work. Hence, this year, I established Nai Subah Foundation, an organization that aims to create opportunities for the marginalized and help them unlock their potential.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q2. What enabled you to look beyond the overt layers of society and delve deeper to discover a mine of talent pool waiting to be availed?<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In October 2021, I was approached by I was approached by Parivartan Special School, which is a school for special needs students under PORDAC NGO (Protection of the Rights of Differently Abled Children) to keep it viable during COVID-19 by fundraising. It is only when I worked with those students, did I realize that the world of neurodiversity is so rich, creative and profound; and that, neurodiverse people actually have many untapped skills that can be harnessed and put to good use. This inspired me to delve deeper towards the goal of empowering the neurodiverse. Thus, Project Nishant came into being, with the aim of creating mainstream employment opportunities for the differently -abled, and equipping them with the tools to increase their income generation capability, self-esteem and independence.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q3. Your initiatives are a true example of supporting diversity and inclusion. Personally, what qualities did you develop that helped you to stride ahead in this direction and manage your NGO?<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My school has built an inclusive ecosystem where sensitivity is one of the core values. Also, my family has always inspired me to work towards solving different challenges the society is facing. So, over the years, I have become increasingly self-aware, empathetic and conscious. Today, I feel I'm driven by my ambition to contribute towards the creation of a society that recognizes and embraces diversity. My compassion, strong desire to make a difference, and time management ability have therefore helped me stride ahead in this direction. I think, growing up in an ecosystem that is focused on values, has curated my thought processes and actions so far.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q4. Time management is crucial. How do you manage your work-life balance, since you have to take care of your studies too?<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have always focused on academics, without compromising on my creative pursuits, or service initiatives. In the process, I have constantly challenged myself on various fronts. Indeed, time management is a skill that I have been constantly working on all these years and I do my best to manage both, studies and the initiatives that I take up, with equal sincerity.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q5. Mainstreaming employment opportunities for neurodiverse people is not a very task. Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you?<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Project Nishant, is a real-world project, hence it is very challenging. From identifying and building partnerships with NGOs to booking appointments, and meeting corporates, nothing is easy! Developing the talent pool of new diverse young adults who are both employable and determined to make the best out of the situation, then matching them up with the skills required by industry partners, figuring out the logistics, and finally, finding companies willing to onboard these candidates, while making the workplace more inclusive and sensitive – the list of challenges is never-ending. Apart from that, I also have, school exams! Yet my passion to do good helps me to work relentlessly toward my goals and juggle work seamlessly. The bright side is that I am happy to realize that most companies nowadays are open to employing neurodiverse people and integrating them into their workplace.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q6. How has your business\/NGO benefitted your life and the lives of the people it has touched? What is your long-term vision?<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On a personal level, Project Nishant, has taught me that there are no boundaries beyond the ones we create in our minds. In terms of its impact on people, I feel that we have truly brought the issue of employment of neurodiversity to the forefront, and addressed it appropriately. The results have been positive, and we found companies with a social conscience and sustainability agenda who are very receptive to our idea. So far, we have reached out to 30 plus companies, and many more are connecting with us to become a part of this project. We have also tasted success with several candidates hired and many more recruitments in progress. Our Virtual Art Exhibition helped showcase the incredible talent of neurodiverse young artists from ages six to twenty-one and was attended by people from across the globe. As our ecosystem grows, more contracts are being on-boarded and we hope that many more will join our platform and be a part of the transformation we seek to create. In the coming years, we aim to usher in a world of opportunities for marginalized people by fostering diversity and inclusion, creating sustainable income generation opportunities through assisted and open employment, by showcasing their talent and creativity. We hope that our efforts will have a cascading effect creating a lasting impact and hopefully a more inclusive society.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q7. Any tips\/advice for someone of your age, who is aspiring to start off a business?<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My advice to other youth my age would be that they should follow their passion, and simultaneously try to work towards creating a sustainable and inclusive world for themselves as well as the future generations, through their endeavors.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Today, Team Sheatwork avails the opportunity to deep dive into a ‘calming communication’ with a yoga instructor who guides students to \"connect to breath\" and relax while conducting a series of physical and mental exercises. Anjali Dimri demonstrates a fundamental knowledge of yoga, and possesses a dynamic and engaging personality laced with excellent communication skills. She is a woman who has ‘rocked the cradle’ and is now set out to ‘relax’ the world!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6><strong>Q1. What propelled you towards becoming a yoga instructor?<br><\/strong><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. I have always been interested in Yoga and have been practicing it for a very long time. I will forever be thankful to my Yoga trainer (sir), who encouraged me to take it up on a professional level as well. I took a short course to connect with, understand and practice yoga in my life and in the process, I started enjoying it. Having personally enjoyed the benefits of practicing yoga, I wanted to share the same with others. Hence my journey as a yoga instructor began.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q2. What according to you, are the strengths that a yoga guide should possess?<br><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. As a Yoga Trainer, one should be empathetic and a good listener. One should understand the problems, needs, challenges and the physical and mental well-being of students in order to cull out the best yoga practices for them. Certain exercises need to be modified in order to suit the student and this is something the Yoga teacher should be able to do.<br><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q3. How long have you been practicing yoga? How do you find competition in your business<br>area?<br><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have been practicing Yoga since my teenage. Owing to my familial duties post-marriage, yoga did take a back-seat for a while. However, for the past 7-8 years I have been an undeterred yoga enthusiast and I thoroughly enjoy it. As far as competition is concerned, it is across fields and jobs. Lately, with growing awareness around mental well-being, we have seen increased interest in Yoga.<br><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q4. Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you?<br><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The biggest challenge in this field is to convince people to start their Yoga Journey. There are many misconceptions surrounding this sphere. Often yoga is perceived as a tool to ‘get well’. Indeed, yoga can cure a number of diseases but it also is a tool to help people ‘remain well’! Also, some have the pre-conceived notion that yoga is for people who cannot exercise a lot, or that Yoga is boring. Most of the time, people start their yoga training because they are ‘prescribed’ to do it. In such cases, although people start their Yoga training enthusiastically, they tend to easily get bored along the way. So, the challenge is – creating awareness – regarding the benefits of Yoga and helping people to perceive yoga as a healthy way of living life.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q5. How do you try to make your sessions different and more beneficial for students?<br><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I try and be as true to Yoga as possible. I do modify the pace and the forms of exercise to make my sessions interesting but ensure that the base is purely Yoga. My foremost focus remains on making people aware of their breathing patterns, which is why all my sessions include ‘Pranayam’ at the end. I have observed that people are not aware of the the wonders ‘Pranayams’ can work for them. Having made my students conscious about the benefit of Pranayams has benefitted them on many accounts.<br><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q6. How has practicing yoga benefited your life? What are your future plans?<br><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yoga is a light, which once lit will never dim. The better your practice, the brighter your flame. Along these lines, I believe, Yoga has transformed my life – physically, mentally and spiritually. Yoga has taught me a lot of things and made me aware of my body, breathing patterns, my mental well-being, among others. Yoga has had a very positive impact on my life, and I will be forever grateful.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>Q7. Any tips for someone aspiring to make a career out of yoga\/ meditation\/ mindfulness? <br><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Please don’t be a part of the crowd. Yoga is a good fitness tool but let’s move beyond weight loss and concentrate on the wellbeing part of it as well. It is a beautiful career choice where you get to handhold people in their journey of wellness and awareness, while simultaneously adding unmatched value to your own well-being as well.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

What was the inspiration that steered you into becoming an entrepreneur?<\/strong>     <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. My entrepreneurial journey began when I decided to enrol my son in a coding program. What I observed during this experience was that, students could not learn or grasp concepts due to lack of practical experience. There was no genuine outcome and most importantly, there was a dearth of knowledge and exposure around both, fundamental programs as well as high-end and professional software and languages.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This motivated me to start MindBox, where we carefully curate courses as per individual students’ needs, interests, pace of learning and style, which in turn helps them to attain 21st century skills.

India’s Edtech ecosystem is brimming with coding led platforms, but we at MindBox, cover the entire technology lifecycle with various programs from Fundamentals, Multimedia, Coding to High-end Design courses and professional courses for children aged between 6-18 years. However, the under-lying potential of Edtech space is enormous, owing to its ability to impact the lives of future generation.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We are the only EdTech platform in India to have STEM Accreditation for Design &amp; Coding Courses.

Our programs run on four major pillars - Design Thinking, Content to Context Methodology, Project Based Learning and Student Centric Learning. We aim to empower students with the 21st century skills of creativity, collaboration, critical thinking, and communication to name a few, and inspire them to become innovators, collaborators, &amp; problem-solvers.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q3. Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you along your journey?<\/strong>   <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. The Covid pandemic was a wakeup call for us here at MindBox. We had to make multiple<br>changes to our overall business model in attempting to not only survive but to also navigate through the obstacles that were raised during the pandemic. Hiring the right talent turned out to be the most difficult aspect during the pandemic - No matter how much capital you have infused in your business, at the end of the day, it is the people who will keep the flag of the organization flying high. Thus, identifying the right person for the right job turned out to be one of the most critical aspects of our day to day working.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q4. How do you find competition in your business space?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. India’s start-up ecosystem is brimming with Edtech start-ups. As per recent industry estimates there are about 9,043 EdTech start-ups in India. The number in itself signifies the kind of competition that exists within this space, and this competitive nature is what makes Edtech an exciting space to work in as it compels you to think out-of-the box. With immersive learning experiences taking centre stage across the entire education scenario in India, creativity becomes a critical factor for success.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q5.

Your passion is what aids your victory. Without passion, you may as well forget your dream and your vision.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Patience<\/span><\/strong> – Patience is key to success as it enables you to stay focused towards your goal and your vision even during the toughest of times.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Perseverance<\/span><\/strong> - Your ability to stay focused and persistent towards your goal is what makes you a successful entrepreneur. The entrepreneurial world is full of success stories of those who stayed long enough and fought their way through every obstacle patiently.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q6. What are your future plans?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. Since our inception, we have been able to expand our reach to 20+ countries, including India. Our plans are to further reach out to other parts of the world in order to make outcome-based design and code learning easily accessible to youngsters globally. By the end of this year, we aspire to empower over 1,00,000 students by serving 150+ schools across 30+ countries globally.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q7. Any tips for someone who is trying to step into entrepreneurship today?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans. Always remember, success can never be accomplished overnight and that there are no<br>shortcuts to success. Be patient, stay focused towards your vision and most importantly stay true to yourself. Entrepreneurship in itself is a journey of enlightenment and therefore it requires a lot of hard work and patience.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Today, on behalf of team Sheatwork, I will delve deeper into the world of a woman who is set out to aspire and inspire.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q1.<\/strong> <strong>What did you think about becoming an entrepreneur?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“You can cut all the flowers but you cannot keep Spring from coming,” said Pablo Neruda. This<br>statement unfolds my entrepreneurial journey perfectly. I belong to a family which is into<br>entrepreneurship for around 200 years! My mother and I were the ‘black sheep’ in the family as we both were into the service industry. However, I believe, what is embedded into your DNA, cannot be simply down away with. Entrepreneurship for me was inevitable; it ‘happened’ when it had to!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q2. What are some strengths that a woman entrepreneur should possess?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As an entrepreneur, there are many roles, responsibilities attached to the person, that are<br>impossible to manage without possessing certain skills. Like the ‘lady of the house’, an entrepreneur too is responsible for everything. So, for women it spells double the efforts to balance home and work judiciously. Being in this field requires a set of qualities, skills, patience, and courage. I believe, confidence, persistence and focus are the three most important strengths any entrepreneur should possess.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q3. Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you? At times I feel so tired of playing so many roles together<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I said, an entrepreneurial journey itself has so many roles, and one has to constantly juggle<br>between the roles to strike the right balance. Sometimes I am a boss, a manager, at another instance I am also a worker, at home I am a mother, a daughter in law , a wife, a teacher and the list is endless! I would not say that it is an easy task, because I have to constantly re-prioritize almost each day, depending on the circumstances, both, at home and in office. However, having managed all the roles well so far has given me the confidence and courage to walk ahead fearlessly because I know that I can do it!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q4. How do you find competition in your business area?<\/strong><br>I have divided my time and efforts amongst the fields of consulting, fashion and food tech. All these three areas are highly competitive and that is what fuels my passion to work hard. I feel the more the competition, the more you become result oriented and focused. Also, I do not work with the aim of ‘winning’ in the market, I work with honesty and sincerity to simply fulfil what I have always dreamt of – succeeding and sharing the success with the society at large!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q5. How did you try to make your business different?<\/strong><br>For us, customer service isn’t just a department; it forms the core of the entire company. We treat our customers like kings, starting from a proposal to the final delivery; we make sure we solve their problems and cater them with enhanced experiences each time. I think, this is what differentiates my venture and sets it as a class-apart.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q6. What are your future plans?<\/strong><br>Upananda which was started 4 years back with an aim to give livelihood to few women is not just the story of fashion but also the story of women empowerment. In association with Dakshini Prayas, an NGO based out of Kolkata, the underprivileged local women were trained while their kids were being taught in Satyabrata Vidyalaya. We helped these women not to earn, but also aided in strengthening their decision-making powers and independence.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After Upananda, my second ‘baby’ is Nanighar, an initiative rolled out keeping in mind women<br>empowerment, while supporting homemakers in realizing their long-cherished dream of becoming a successful entrepreneur. Nanighar is not merely a food delivery system, it is a food tech start up, 4th year running, aiming to make India healthier by providing healthy &amp; tasty food made by none other than “the Moms and home chefs” of India and by empowering women from their own kitchen. The App is hand-holding women from being a Queen in their own homes to getting into people’s hearts through their culinary skills. It is where you can get healthy, home-cooked food and indeed, you are spoilt for choices as the cuisines traverse geographies.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>During the lockdown, these ‘mom chefs’ along with their teams, made everyone proud as they<br>worked tirelessly and braved challenges like procuring ingredients for preparing food and finding willing riders for delivering it to those who needed home-cooked food. The pandemic gave them the opportunity to work with Organizations like Pronam Kolkata and deliver food to 1000 senior citizens of Kolkata and many covid patients. Business wise they have suffered as the corporate bookings took a backstage, but they had the chance to earn good will and concurrently also increase the customer base. Today Nanighar can proudly say that more than 80% of their customers are the repeat customers and they love #maakahatkakhana.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Expanding this noble venture, Nanighar into 10 more cities and helping 10000 women to join the initiative is what I plan to do next. Currently, Nanighar has more than 20k plus downloads, 30k plus customers we have around 600 chefs who are work-from-home, financially independent, confident women entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q7. Any tips for someone starting out today?<\/strong><br>I would say, there are four golden rules you must take into account while embarking on your<br>entrepreneurial journey -<br>&gt; Refine your business idea.<br>&gt; Know your competitors and the market; research well.<br>&gt; Create your business plan.<br>&gt; Choose your business structure carefully.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Hence, I took it upon myself to create a brand that could speak the language of Indian women at the workplace &amp; beyond.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the other hand, my husband Rohit Mohan Pugalia, being a very sociable person, was fortunate enough to interact with personalities from all walks of life during his entrepreneurial journey. During this journey, he observed an unexplored market gap in India where western workwear apparel &amp; accessories for women could use some vibrancy to break away from the monotony set by the standard boardroom colours.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Through our own set of unique experiences, we both arrived at the same conclusion, and that’s how Not So Pink was incorporated<em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q 2. Tell us, what is your definition of fashion?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans- Fashion isn't about what malls highlight just to make clothes take off their racks, or what some international brands make you believe after setting confined beauty standards. Fashion is a way to express one's personality. Some buy apparel to suit their shape, and others, after seeing a famous personality flaunt it. But I have learned that it should be the other way round because your fashion statement should reflect your personality. Also, it's vital to keep comfort at the forefront when choosing outfits while also ensuring you pick versatile statement pieces that can be mixed &amp; matched effortlessly all year round.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q3. What prompted you to think of this unique name for your brand?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans- The Indian woman of today is setting the benchmark in the business world every single day. Her powerful presence in the corporate environment has proven that she’s got what it takes to take any challenge head-on. She's not one to follow the crowd, which is why she makes it to new unexplored heights of success very often.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She’s achieved so much and aspires to do so much more, but society still looks at her through the lens of some age-old stereotypes, like her association with the colour pink! Her personality has often been incorrectly assumed as girlish, soft, and overly emotional, while the ground reality is drastically different for Indian women &amp; the colour pink. At Not So Pink, we aspire to challenge the many stereotypes faced by Indian women at the workplace &amp; beyond.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q4. What is the essence of your brand and how does it cater to women beyond preconceived notions and age-old stereotypes?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans- Not So Pink makes bold &amp; expressive western work wear to fit ambitious &amp; impressive Indian women. Our outfits are created keeping comfort &amp; versatility at the forefront - western work wear that can easily be donned from noon to moon with ease. We came into existence so that women don't have to pick between comfort &amp; style. Also, there was a dire need for contemporary apparel &amp; accessories that offer an incredible fit to Indian women of all body types, which is why we offer every style ranging from XS-XXXL.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It caters to women beyond preconceived notions &amp; stereotypes because why should everyone be confined to dull boardroom colours &amp; patterns? Our vibrant apparel gives a spin to the otherwise drab workwear and redefines office attire for Indian women. Moreover, there's an age-old saying in the fashion industry - 'dress according to your shape'. But we encourage women to 'embrace their curves' because they are beautiful the way they are, and nobody can tell them otherwise. We want women to be proud of their shapes and not feel pressured by the narrow-minded definition of 'ideal beauty' introduced by some brands in the fashion industry. Just wear what makes you happy, feel confident and express yourself comfortably.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q5. If you could go back and tell yourself one thing before launching your brand, what would it be?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans- Before the launch of Not So Pink, we had two plans in mind. One blueprint was more dominant on establishing a retail presence, to begin with, and another one that targeted digital &amp; online platforms. The pandemic really transformed people's purchase behaviours &amp; the definition of western workwear since 'work from home' emerged.&nbsp; That's why I would go back in time and tell myself that we opted for the right business plan that was more dominant on the online front and it was the correct decision to create comfortable &amp; multi-utility apparel &amp; accessories that are ideal for women at every level in the corporate ladder.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q6. What is your favourite part about owning ‘Not So Pink’ and how do you want women to feel when wearing your clothes?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans- My favourite part about owning Not So Pink is that we follow a body-inclusive approach and aspire to redefine the traditional size chart for women’s workwear in India. Not So Pink’s focus is to make garments that are long-lived. We are constantly working towards offering fresh styles to our consumers with similar aesthetics. I also feel proud of the ability to highlight the high-flying nature &amp; the remarkable journey of the quintessential Indian woman with our #NotSoTypical marketing campaign on our social media platforms.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I want women to feel confident, comfortable &amp; reassured when they don western workwear &amp; accessories by Not So Pink. She will exude confidence because the outfits reflect her personality, experience comfort since we are a ‘desk to date’ companion and feel reassured because of our presence at every step in their journey to success and celebrations after.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q7. Where do you see yourself and the Indian Fashion Industry in the next 10 years?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans- The fashion domain is an ever-evolving space, and the pandemic has also contributed to changing how workwear today is perceived. Women are slowly starting to demand professional apparel with comfort &amp; functionality as the cornerstone. I see a rise in demand for zero maintenance workwear and eclectic styles at the workplace in the coming years. Today the old-fashioned Indian corporate environment dominates how people dress to work, but I foresee young independent working professionals in the future taking matters into their own hands and wearing whatever resonates with their style. Not to forget the trend of sustainable fashion that's on the rise. Many new practices are being developed and support being offered towards sustainable fashion each day because it bodes well for the future of the industry, planet and humankind at large.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once Not So Pink has established itself in the hearts, minds &amp; wardrobes of Indian women, years later, I see myself being receptive to the pain point of consumers in another domain and trying to solve a problem for them to the best of my ability.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q8. What advice would you give to young designers\/entrepreneurs just starting out and hoping to make it big in the fashion industry?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans- Many conversations &amp; campaigns in the world of fashion revolve around ‘perfection &amp; ideal beauty’. But beauty isn't just limited to a select few women with a zero size figure. In my opinion, this isn't even a topic of discussion because beauty comes in all shapes &amp; sizes, which is a change emerging slowly but surely in the fashion sphere. For anyone just starting out in the fashion industry, I would like to say that fashion should always revolve around size positivity &amp; body inclusivity because then you are not only part of the industry &amp; business - you become part of a movement. My message for young designers would be to create apparel that boosts confidence &amp; complements people's personalities. Don't just create pieces to wear; make designs that people can carry with pride. My advice to young entrepreneurs would be that they should not let fear get the best of them and always follow their dreams and move ahead with utmost self-belief. The life of an entrepreneur is full of challenges &amp; risks, but it is precisely that which makes the journey fruitful. Take calculated risks that will eventually define your character, and always have an alternate plan of action in mind. Also, ensure that the people in your organization are growing alongside the company and your words &amp; actions are constantly aligned. This should assist budding entrepreneurs to leave an impact in the world of business &amp; fashion.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

We are implementing one of the largest skilling machines in the world, and being closely associated with the industry and academia, MEPSC has been part of many forums which work on innovation and entrepreneurship at various levels; also the advent of the National Education Policy 2020 showed a focus on vocational education and its derivatives from Class VII onwards. We discussed and came up with this idea –which actually Shivani initiated. We had been trying to get around school and college students and “Catch them Young”, and we try to get the spirit of entrepreneurial mindset and critical thinking ability and to harness those cognitive skills among young minds.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, we conceptualised and started working on building the brand; and soon after that, we had a webinar for school and college students, and the whole idea was to work out a product that could act as a symposium of ideas, which could harness the spirit of innovation and nurture it to build on entrepreneurship. We then onboarded CBSC, IIMs, IITs and opportunities are coming up every day. We are reaching out to the youth of the country, from Class VI to Class XII to collect ideas that are workable and can be converted into ventures (and we want to collect 1 lakh ideas as we go along).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby: Could you talk about the Youth Ideathon and also your personal journeys into entrepreneurship?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shivani: <\/strong>It was an initiative based on my personal journey, and I’ve been fortunate to come from a family that was able to access the best of education and the opportunities that go with it. But, even then, I realised in my 30s that there is a huge gap in our education system. A lot of learning goes waste – we learn through subjects, assignments, which is the aim of the education system. When I started my journey as an entrepreneur, I realised that as humans, we have so much more potential. At the school level we are not harnessing that potential. In some ways, education opens up our minds but it is also limiting us. We are not able to connect what we are learning to what we can achieve. So, we think Startup was a genesis – had it happened while I was at school, I could have indeed, achieved more. There’s so much talent, so much potential and we are not harnessing that. We started at a grassroots level and work with students across the country – in Tier 1 &amp; 2 cities, and vilages; it’s two years now, and we tried to understand the problem. A lot of market education is required.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We both had a mental connect and we focussed on - could we energise the system to get school leaders, educationists, industry leaders, policymakers on board? Could we drive innovation and entrepreneurship at the school level?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby: How is the Ideathon happening? How are you and MEPSC collaborating to make this a success<\/strong>?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shivani:<\/strong> With MEPSC’s reach into government policymaking and our reach into the startup world – it has been a good tie-up to support this movement. To get it working we have a 6-week period and we have a portal called <a href=\"http:\/\/www.youthideathon.in\">www.youthideathon.in<\/a>. Here there’s a lot of access to resources and through the month we have webinars for teachers, schools, students; and the idea is to have schools and students participating. Students had not been exposed to this before, so there’s an opening up of the child’s mind to think – “I am not part of a large eco-system but I am capable of changing things”. We find we have to do a bit of education and mentoring, and once students realise that they have the potential, we see very good ideas coming from them! This portal is open till October 24.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We’re enabling teachers and educational leaders to mentor students as well as ‘youth idea ambassadors’. Beyond that, we will be picking 500 most promising ideas and will conduct video interviews, which is really to see the passion! The Top 100 we will take into a mentored incubation process, the idea being to energise the system.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby: How is MEPSC working towards the goal of mass skilling and entrepreneurship in the country?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Col Pokhriyal: <\/strong>MEPSC has been relentlessly working towards contributing to the growth story of India through the Skill India Mission. Keeping in line with that objective, we have created national occupational standards essentially to inculcate the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation. We are trying to partner with multiple organisations and forums, where we are creating a mass movement to empower the youth, to become ‘solopreneurs’ with massive outreach through its qualifications, with minimum investment in the eco-system. Since we are partnered with various entrepreneurship forums, we have been actively creating platforms for the youth of the country to share their entrepreneurial journeys (especially the youth in a rural background). The movement tries to push various Government of India schemes like Start-Up India, Atmanirbhar Bharat, Make in India, Skill India – so that we have a very powerful system that can sustain the massive investment.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We’re trying to guide and mentor the youth, especially women, to come out with powerful ideas, which can go towards entrepreneurship. The idea and effort of MEPSC is to look for huge opportunities which can be created, when the ideas become sustainable. This is the transformable change we are trying to bring about - a change in the mindset of parents, teachers, students and society at large - that entrepreneurship is the way forward.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby: What has been the response now from students (especially the female students) and teachers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shivani:<\/strong> With the teachers we are receiving immense response, and I think they have realised that the system needs a shake-up! We have been oversubscribed too, as per the number of participants we can take.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Talking about the representation of girls in big cities, we find a good mix (60:40 in terms of girls who are interested). However, when you move away from cities, it is heart-breaking, as it is 80:20. I think conditioning is happening at many levels – at home, society. Another heart-breaking part was when we had an Entrepreneurship Hackathon in the rural areas, the ideas that came up were – women’s safety, access to education showing that there are issues girls in smaller towns are facing. We have to attack this at multiple levels, which is why “Youth Ideathon” should become a powerful changemaker!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby: Do you feel educational institutions are the foundation pillars to building a successful start-up ecosystem?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Col Pokhriyal: <\/strong>I am a firm believer of that. There are many examples. In recent times, in Delhi and many cities there was the Swachh Bharat Mission carried out by the government where teachers taught health and hygiene was the focus; then there were many other initiatives like  Say ‘No’ to Plastics, Pollution or Crackers, Plant MoreTrees etc. Teachers are the role models and parents also have a role; but I feel teachers have a bigger role, for whatever comes from the teachers’ mouth is taken as a gospel truth!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, I am 100% convinced that teachers and schools have a very important role to play for the betterment of society and the country at large.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby: Who are your partners who have come forward to join the “Youth Ideathon”?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shivani:<\/strong>  We had conceptualised the idea very fast, and on August 27 was the first webinar. Since then, the kind of partners that have come forward has been amazing. Of course, CBSC was a huge boost for us, at our innovation centres. Then we have incubation partners – IIT Roorkee, IIMs, and corporates like Bajaj Finance, Macmillan and many more. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We feel extremely energised with the nature of the scale of partnerships, and more are joining even now.

I feel every human is a great entrepreneur.&nbsp; I think life is a start-up. It’s not about men and women; women make good entrepreneurs, so do men. Through my own journey, I feel it is hugely ‘empowering’ – to be able to define your life on your terms.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And I am passionate about women entrepreneurs, I do support them and I am involved in a bit of angel investing.

The Group has&nbsp;28&nbsp;businesses including nine listed Companies traded in NSE &amp; BSE. For generations, the management of the Murugappa Group has been a ‘male- only’ bastion; and it is for the first time, that Valli Arunachalam, a PhD in nuclear engineering with 23 years of work experience and the elder daughter of the late M.V. Murugappan, former Executive Chairman, is fighting for her right to be inducted in&nbsp;Murugappa Group's&nbsp;board. Her being a daughter is posing as her biggest obstacle, and paradoxically, it is from being a woman that she draws her greatest courage; the courage to object, to face opposition and overcome obstacles to achieve her goals! <em>S<\/em><em>heatwork<\/em><em> <\/em>requests her to share her story to inspire more women to shatter the glass ceiling and look beyond.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q1<\/strong>. Can you tell us about your journey as an entrepreneur and struggles, especially now, when you are battling the pain of your father’s loss?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans – My story is a story about oppression and marginalization of daughters in India. It is a story about their equality and justice. There are millions of such stories in India but they are swept away under the rug. I want these stories including mine, to be heard and addressed – and that is what I am fighting for. The Murugappa family still follows the age old tradition of patriarchy and the inheritance pathway is chalked in sync with this tradition. However, although the other branches of the Murugappa family followed the patriarchal tradition of inheritance, my father, a person with foresight and trust in the abilities of women,  chose the path untread so far. He willed my mother, my sister and me as the legacy bearers of his part in the family business. Today we are demanding only what is rightfully ours, but it is a pity that even in the present age where women entrepreneurship supports any economy in a big way, we still have to ‘ASK’ for what belongs to us! However, inspite of many push-backs, we remained consistent in our efforts and proposed many options of wrapping up the matter amicably; but the family summarily rejected all our proposals. Based on my significant share holding I asked for a board seat in the holding company to protect my family’s significant shareholding in the business - which was denied basis many ‘excuses’. I had hoped to bring fresh ideas to the family business and contribute meaningfully but that was not allowed to happen. Also, it was shocking to witness the induction of an inexperienced member of the family into the Ambadi Board after the demise of his father, but an experienced person like me getting voted out on gender basis.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That was a moment of reckoning for me. I view this as a vote against the values and principles enshrined in the Constitution of India. I felt it was my responsibility to stand up against this discrimination. My struggles are just one of the many struggles which Indian women face today and through my fight I hope to inspire Indian women to stand up for their rights. This is the 21st century and women deserve to be treated equal to men. This forced restructuring exercise at the Murugappa Group is indeed ‘unfortunate’, because it validates the fact that the company has failed to keep pace with time in an era when women are an integral part of the workforce.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q2<\/strong>. Currently is there a mandate that there should be a woman director in all listed companies?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans – Yes, there is a SEBI regulation mandating atleast one independent woman director in the top thousand listed companies; BUT the holding company of the Murugappa Group, although a listed company, does not rank in the top thousand. So here, it is not mandated.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q3<\/strong>. It is surprising that apart from your late father, none of the other men in your family are progressive when it comes to travelling with the changing times. Have you received any support openly\/behind the scenes from the younger generation of men in the family business?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans- No, I have not received any support from them either publicly or privately and in this day and age this is incomprehensible.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q4<\/strong>. Other than your immediate women family members, have the women in your extended family supported you in this fight against inequality?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans- Unfortunately, again the answer is ‘No’.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q5<\/strong>. What is it that still keeps you going and swim against the tide, alone?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans – I am a nuclear engineer and I have this store house of nuclear power in me which keeps me going!! Jokes apart, it is my passion and commitment for the greater cause – gender equality, women empowerment - which keeps me going despite all the struggles and setbacks. I have complete faith in the judicial system and I believe that if you fight for what is right, justice will be delivered. I tell myself every night that I have done the best I could today, tomorrow is another day…and I will do better!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q6<\/strong>. Do you feel your journey would have been easier if other family businesses had allowed more women in leadership roles or if there would be more women entrepreneurs in families?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans- Undoubtedly, the answer would be yes!! Women have so much to contribute to the family business and incorporating everyone’s strength, men and women, to develop and grow the family business is the way to go. Today women are educated, aware, digitally equipped and it is time that businesses understood the contributions which women can make. There have been numerous studies vouching for the enormous growth women can bring to businesses and the economy. Many large corporations have moved towards gender equality and have reaped the benefits of it. So, we need to learn from them and strive towards gender equality.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q7<\/strong>. Somewhere do you feel women themselves are to be blamed for not challenging themselves to move ahead and manage family businesses with intelligence, agility and hard work?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans- In a patriarchy, women are suppressed from a very young age. It is very difficult for women to tear out of that. It takes a lot of courage and determination to come out of that mind-set and doubling their troubles is the financial dependency they face. These factors contribute to the fact that women hesitate to take charge. However, I was fortunate because both my parents were forward thinking individuals and they ensured that I had excellent education to be able to pursue my passion. Both, my sister and I , even though we come from a patriarchal family, we made our mark! This independence is what is fueling me in my fight. I would encourage other women who are in patriarchal systems and family businesses, to pursue their dreams.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q8<\/strong>. How do think a woman can survive and thrive in male dominated industries?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans- Let us look around us – despite having the workload of household chores, despite being faced with many hurdles, women multi-task efficiently to excel in both, their jobs on the professional front and chores at home. This, I think is remarkable. Women should become more conscious of their abilities and move ahead. Women should seek help from support groups, visualize their passion and commit to fulfil their dreams. I have received support from men and women from all walks of life- ordinary people to the captains of the industry, both, in India and abroad, and am extremely humbled by the experience. &nbsp;I wish to tell all aspiring women entrepreneurs that indeed it will be a difficult journey and there will be more downfalls than successes; but remember to stand up every time you fall, learn from your errors and charge ahead.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q9<\/strong>. What is your advice to society, people in general, on how to embrace gender equality in a better manner both, at home and in the outside world?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans-&nbsp; I think it is important to recognize that the world is changing. We have to be flexible and change with changing times if we wish to be successful anywhere, including businesses. When 50% of your consumers are women, we should realize that unless we revamp the leadership roles, make place for women in other rungs of the business and strive for gender equality, we will not be doing justice to the business and shareholders. We require both, men and women to realize this and work together for the common good of society and the business.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q10<\/strong>. When you achieve what you are fighting for, what is that one change you would bring about to support women across the country?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ans- I have been committed to women empowerment, especially women education through my father’s charitable trust for a long time now. It is not something novel I would be doing after a decision has been reached in my favor. I feel, I owe it to society to return what I got from society – a good education, the opportunity to pursue a career and carve out an identity for myself. I want this to be possible for all women and that is what I have been working towards for a long time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

She completed her Dental Residency from AIIMS followed by her Masters in Dental Surgery. However, while honing her skills in dentistry, she also realised her inclination towards singing. She is currently running her chain of dental and skin care centres Rejove Clinique in Delhi\/NCR. Dr. Goyat shared with sheatwork, how her unwavering commitment towards helping people made her take up medicine.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Read on as she shares her journey and future endeavours to tide over the pandemic, her advise for women entrepreneurs and much more….<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What are the factors that made you take up medicine as a profession?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>PG: I chose medicine because I always felt compassion towards people and nursed the desire to do my bit in helping them. Dentistry on its own is a complete science. It is a perfect combination of aesthetics &amp; science and can make a huge impact and difference in the way people look, feel and function.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How do you manage to devote time towards singing along with your professional commitments?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>PG: Singing has always been my passion since I was young. I also like challenging situations and managing both singing and medicine often pushes my limits, but it's also very exciting. It’s often said that once you choose a profession that you love, you don't feel that you're working every day. I think it's the same for me. I love singing and I love my medicine aesthetics, where I can beautify people. And singing adds the perfect flavour of happiness in my life that also reflects in my work.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How do manage to find time for ‘Riyaz’ for singing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>PG: I'm an early riser and dawn of the day is the perfect time to reconnect with yourself. And I believe singing and ‘Riyaz’ is a form of meditation that actually made me more focused to deliver better results at work.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The ongoing pandemic has put a tremendous amount of strain on the field of medicine and medical professionals. How challenging was it for you to manage your chain of clinics in this pandemic?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>PG: The pandemic has been a challenge for all the business’ and ours is no different. We opted for a leaner management &amp; cut down on unnecessary overheads just to maintain our never-ending dedication to serve people. We also had to downsize from five clinics to three clinics. We even found out one of my key directors was cheating on us. Our entire business perspective also changed as majority of our clientele came from the international market and with global travel closing down, we had to make the necessary deviations. However, we kept moving with our unwavering commitment of serving people and it has been very rewarding.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What is the single biggest challenge to strike a work-life balance?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>PG: To manage your professionalism, which is your daily bread &amp; butter, as well as being a full-time mother to an infant and being there for the family in the time of need is challenging. One has to be highly attentive and productive to manage all these fields and when we attain that kind of focus, it becomes easy and comes naturally to you, just like your daily chores.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What suggestions would you like to give to aspiring women entrepreneurs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>PG: I would suggest them to set up their own independent practices and believe in themselves, even when no one else would. Strive, pursue and not give up on their goals, no matter how much the world puts them down. Also, never let anyone tell them that they are not good enough because their efforts to establish themselves prove that they are better than scores of people out there.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>What are your future plans?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>PG: To remain at the forefront of technology and innovation and provide quality treatment through our unwavering focus is our endeavour. I am looking to expand my chain of clinics and we are already introducing new techniques in the field of dentistry like a 3D scan system and much more. We want Rejove Clinique to be synonymous with quality treatment all across the country by staying true to our ethos &amp; principles, which is non-negotiable for us.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

To work you need to ‘feel’.”<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The pandemic has forced many of us to reckon with different feelings and situations and its having a documented negative impact on people’s mental and physical health; and one powerful tool people are turning to are practices like yoga, mindfulness and other fitness formats, giving rise to many entrepreneurs in this space, observed Ruby Sinha, founder sheatwork, in a conversation with Natalie Pote, fitness entrepreneur, who wears many hats. She is a fitness coach, who is present here for the Athletics &amp; Fitness Association of America, certified trainer from the National&nbsp; Academy of Sports Medicine, USA, certified nutrition coach, a licensed yoga and zumba expert, choreographer, teacher and event planner.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Read on, as she discusses her journey, the team, support system, the challenges faced, the marketing mantras she follows, some fitness tips and more….<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS. Take us through your journey. How did you become a fitness coach?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP:&nbsp; Honestly, it’s something inborn, something I always wanted to do, but didn’t know how. For our generation, while growing up, it wasn’t really a profession or a career option for women or young girls. Now, thankfully, it’s accepted.<br>It was my students and clients who inspired me. I started off as a zumba instructor and I was inspired by my students seeing how much fun they were having and how much they were letting go! I saw how physical fitness made them feel so good and I realised I wanted to take this further. One thing led to another –zumba to group fitness, personal training which led to nutrition, yoga….I keep learning!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: When you started the venture, you were alone. What sort of a team do you have to help you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: While conceptualizing, the creativity – first let me tell you I have a bit of OCD! I want everything my way and I want it done perfectly.&nbsp; The backend work is mostly done by me but sometimes I need help. I have a team of dedicated people like if I am working with schools I have a group of young college students, who have grown with me.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: Basically if you’re running it solo, you created a network, a support system, who is there, if you have a big project coming up.<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: Absolutely.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: What are the important pre-requisites for setting up your own fitness venture?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: Fitness is contrary to what people believe. For a lot of them approach me and one of them said that he had space and no pillar, so a studio can be started! <strong><em>I feel a call to fitness is not a job, it’s a vocation. To work you need to ‘feel’. Your client is not just a client you are responsible for their lives, their well-being and I mean their mental well-being as well.<br><\/em><\/strong>Once I stopped a trainer telling a lady not to try zumba and he said – “Look at you!” I stopped him and chastised him. Then there was a lady in her 60s, who was motivated and I didn’t expect her to do what I do; for people it’s their belief, it’s that one hour when they can be them! Coming back to the trainer, I told the owners that if he did not apologise, I am not working here!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: You’re saying that you should respect your client, build a bond and have a passion. It’s not like any other job – a Mom&amp;Pop store and get someone else to do the job for you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: Absolutely. You cannot tell a client that, for then, you have demotivated her!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: Throughout your journey, especially during the pandemic, have you seen more and more people come for training virtually, or what are the challenges you were facing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: To be honest with you, when it was a complete lockdown, it actually worked in my favour! I had more people online. One reason is that people have started realizing the benefits of working out, of fitness.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: Do you see more of women in this business? How is the gender issue here, according to you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: For zumba, yes there are more women. When it comes to personal training, I see more men. Coming to the earlier stereotype, girls did not do this. It was men for fitness and girls for dance and zumba. Now women are doing it and women clients are more comfortable with women. It’s changed now.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: While training, clients come from metros. Do you have any clients from non-metros?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: Not really!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: How important is marketing for you, especially during the pandemic. Have you been using digital marketing tools amplifying your social media account to promote your business?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: To some extent yes. I don’t have a paid account, it is still a general account but it has translated to work. I have quite a few students, especially from other parts of the world, like right now, after this interview, I have a class for students in Chicago! It’s making world so much smaller. Being online has taken a lot from us, but at the same time, you have to weigh the pros and cons and make it work for you!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: Does most of your business comes from reference (through your website)?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: A lot of it is through referrals of late, and LinkedIn&nbsp; has actually helped and also&nbsp; my social media account on Instagram.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: As a woman entrepreneur, we lead very stressful lives. What are your fitness&nbsp; tips for women entrepreneurs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: My advice would be – just like when you go to work, you have a routine, create one. Have a routine, and stick to it.<br>Also have a ‘Do not disturb’ sign (which I put up on the back of my chair and my kids know ‘Mummy is not available now’)<br>Create boundaries.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: You have yoga, zumba, cardio and a host of other terminologies. What would you recommend for Indian women?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: I would recommend a little bit of everything. Everyday I teach something different. You will have something different to look forward to everyday. So, it really works.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: I was looking at your qualifications and you have a lot of international degrees. Do you feel it helps, that it should be a pre-requisite? Or can you go with Indian degrees?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: Sadly there is a difference between a license and certification. A license is something you get after doing &nbsp;a workshop you pay for; and then you are licensed to teach. A certification is when you actually study, do an exam and them practice. A lot of people are confused and assume if they are licensed to teach one thing, they can teach everything, they can go to Youtube and copy-paste workouts. Unfortunately, they are getting by, because of the rates they charge. But many question crop up. &nbsp;As far as clients go – how consistent are these workouts? How good is it for the body? What is going to happen in the long run?&nbsp; These are questions that trainers cannot answer and clients don’t ask for people mostly have a particular immediate reason – like getting ready for a wedding, so losing weight for a short period.<br>What I feel is that consistency is key and I feel clients deserve it. As for me, I am empowered and I empower them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: As an entrepreneur it’s so difficult to take off time - one or two hours to exercise. How do you manage it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: It’s putting the cart before the horse sometimes. You need to prioritize. It’s more of a lifestyle. It’s a vicious cycle. What I would say is – just find the time! Like a quick 15 min <em>surya namaskar<\/em> to start your day with. Once you start your day you will be motivated to come back to it!<br>As for me, my yoga mat is on the floor always, and as I get time, I move to a quick exercise and then, it’s back to work. That’s how I keep myself fit!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: Any finishing tips for any aspiring fitness coaches in the younger generation?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>NP: First get into it, get a feel of it. It’s not about coaching the body, but the mind. Know you are unique and you can do it! Enjoy the journey, celebrate your body, celebrate the little things on the way!!<br>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Looking at the important role of the ‘family’ in women’s entrepreneurial experiences we have seen that family ties inevitably have an impact on their performance. Research has also verified the existence of this strong bond. So, obviously the “family dimension” has a huge impact - especially the role played by fathers.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The women entrepreneurs’ segment has been on the rise and in 2020, India ranked 112 in terms of the gender gap in the overall workforce.

Empowering us - was his most important mantra. He believed that given equal opportunity, a woman would make her place.

As a businessman, he went through a roller coaster ride of success and failure. For him, I was the intelligent one, who could achieve anything! He made me feel invincible perhaps, that is where my strong sense of independence comes from. Fearless of change I embrace and crave new experiences and seek adventure. I never saw my gender as a limitation. It was only after I grew up, I realised how fortunate I was to have a father who saw me for who I am, and ensured my gender never became an excuse to not to do anything.

He would somehow manage to take out time from his busy life to enjoy a good laugh with friends, watch his favourite team play football, celebrate community events or simply enjoy a good home-made meal, which taught me a life-long lesson in work-life balance, which is more of work-life integration now.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

In going a step further in becoming ‘Atma Nirbhar’ and adopting digitization, FM Nirmala Sitharaman presented her first paperless, Union Budget, read out from a ‘Made in India’ tablet! She announced a slew of measures on healthcare and infrastructure to give an impetus to the COVID-hit economy. The Budget for the fiscal year 2021-22 is “like never before”, as it is proposed under circumstances like ‘never seen before’ to pull up the economy ‘like never before’! Where Congress leader Rahul Gandhi &nbsp;highlighted sectors that the government “must” focus on in their&nbsp;Budget, including the MSME sector, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the&nbsp;budget&nbsp;would &nbsp;focus on &nbsp;– Health, Human capital, innovation and R&amp;D Physical infrastructure along with featuring <strong>every section<\/strong> of the society.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While the entire nation sat hopefully, glued to their television sets and social media to know about the&nbsp; government’s plan to spend their money for the next year, here are some reactions we got from successful&nbsp; entrepreneurs about the Union Budget 2021:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Jahnabi Phookan, National President, FICCI FLO - &nbsp;<\/strong>“<strong>The Budget proposed by the Finance Minister will help to boost the revival of our nation’s economy following the COVID induced economic fallout.<\/strong> With its targeted proposals for extending benefits to women in form of policies such as Mega Investments Textiles Park, incentivising one-person companies, implementation of the four labour codes, dedicating 3000 crore to NATS, proposal of funds for the welfare of tea workers especially the women &amp; children in Assam &amp; West Bengal,&nbsp; it will provide a strong foundation for the female strata to rise and thereby support in building an Atmanirbhar Bharat”.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Ruby Sinha, Founder, sheatwork<\/strong>&nbsp; - “<strong>The Budget has some welcome initiatives for all sectors. Appreciating that women had a tough time coping with the post pandemic situation and the need for women empowerment , the Budget is aimed at boosting employment opportunities for women.<\/strong>&nbsp; While tabling the Budget, the FM said that minimum wages will apply to all categories of workers. Women will be allowed to work in all categories and also in night shifts with adequate protection which is a positive move. Free cooking gas LPG scheme, Ujjwala scheme extension to one crore more beneficiaries are other positives for women. The Budget overall boosts entrepreneurship, encouraging one-person startups as well. &nbsp;This will help women to start ventures from home and scale up as need be. Steps to boost education and healthcare will ensure easier access to these facilities to large sections of the population, including women.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shammi Pant, Co-founder, MyJen.ai - <\/strong>\"<strong>This budget reinforces the focus on the fundamentals with intent to revive the economy from the unprecedented pandemic setback of last year.&nbsp; <\/strong>In a major way it focuses on Health, Infrastructure and further rationalization of our financial regulations, which is going to give the economy an impetus in revival and put the focus back on fundamentals. The startup community welcomes the attention given in Budget speech of the Finance Ministry and we thank the government for announcements regarding Tax Holidays and Capital Gain Exemptions.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Parbati Bhattacharya, Proprietor, Wanderers Footprints Travel Boutique–<\/strong> “<strong>This Budget has been presented in the shadow of an unprecedented crisis and Government efforts are commendable. Even so, I am disappointed because the Budget has overlooked the Hospitality Industry<\/strong>. The industry really needs some support as it is amongst the worst hit by the pandemic. While the situation is beginning to improve, the hit has been huge and a little support from the government would have been more than welcome. However, as a woman, I like the part which in an attempt to reinvigorate Human Capital, grants women the freedom to work in all categories with adequate protection.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Himani Mishra, CEO &amp; Co-Founder, Brand Radiator - <\/strong>\"<strong>My expectations as a woman entrepreneur are that the Government and its allies, autonomous organisations, must provide relief in EMD, Total Turnover requirement, and experience years, besides other complicated terms and conditions, in its purchases\/procurements, to promote Women Entrepreneurship. <\/strong>As ‘Women Entrepreneurship’ is a new chapter in Indian Business, women have mostly not achieved large number of years in experience and have lesser turnover, as well.I would like to quote Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam, our beloved, former President, who said “Empowering women is a prerequisite for creating a good nation; when women are empowered, society with stability is assured\".&nbsp; Empowerment of women is essential as their value system leads to the development of a good family, society and ultimately a good nation.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Romira Roy, Chairman, SEED<\/strong> - “<strong>The six-pack budget proposed by the Finance Minister encompasses the true spirit of sustainable and equal growth<\/strong>. The push for the health sector and the skilling space with tie-ups with UAE and Japan, to begin with, will go a long way. The focus on revamping the health infrastructure, the push for aggressive disinvestment with LIC’s IPOs, Tax holiday for start-up, expansion &amp; strengthening of nameless faceless IT along with the revision of years are something to be applauded. Although tax slab revisions &amp; further involvement of the private sector in the COVID vaccination distribution is something that could have also been looked at. Over all, it was a well-balanced budget given the fiscal deficit constraints”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Usha Jha, Owner, Petal Crafts<\/strong> – “In all, I feel, the Budget is a well-proposed one. A good portion has been allocated for infrastructure development, healthcare sector and education; and this is a positive step. However, the common man will be affected due to the increase in petrol prices by 2.50 rupees because logistic expenses will increase, thereby making necessary, everyday usage items costlier. Also, the middle class has not been granted any tax-relief and this is a little disheartening. Another cause for concern is that, custom duty on raw silk and cotton have been increased.”<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;In conclusion, as an Indian citizen, a representative of the common masses, I would like to share my view, that,&nbsp; balancing growth with fiscal prudence is what a budget should &nbsp;aim to do. <strong>I perceive the Union Budget 2021,&nbsp; as a shift in gears to help accelerate the pace of economic growth of our country. Hopefully, if the government ‘walks’ the impressive talks, Budget 2021 will indeed be seen as the ‘Budget of the century’!<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

      "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anisha Singh is an Indian digital entrepreneur, known for speaking her mind especially while advocating women rights and promoting women entrepreneurship. Anisha began her career with the Clinton Administration on Capitol Hill, helping women entrepreneurs raise funding. She worked with Centra Software in Boston setting-up e-learning ecosystems. Her return to India saw the launch of Kinis Software, which provides digital content solutions. Leaping ahead, in 2009 she launched mydala, which is now India’s largest local services marketing platform. Again, she launched She Capital, which invests to help women-led businesses scale the maximum heights. <strong><em>She believes in defining successin her own terms, achieving it by her own rules, relishing it and using it to help others and living a life she is proud to live. Today she shares the story of her entrepreneurial journey with us.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Q. Yours has been an inspirational journey, especially for women entrepreneurs. Tell us what prompted you to take the leap into entrepreneurship and eventually set up She Capital?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A. There was never a grand plan which I had. I had seen my father go through hard times in his business, so I had decided NEVER to be an entrepreneur! However, one should perhaps never say ‘never’ because then that is what you end up doing. I had a company prior to mydala, which I sold in the US and started mydala. I think once you get bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, it only results in getting addicted to entrepreneurship. When I started talking globally about women entrepreneurs during my tenure at mydala, the numbers and data bared were dismal and sad. It was then that I realized that something needs to be done because only 2% of the total universe funding went to women entrepreneurs. By 2012-2013, I was mentoring many women entrepreneurs, so it was evident that the community of women entrepreneurs was growing but the funding was not there; thus, when I couldn’t find a solution for this problem, I decided to create the solution myself. That is how <strong><em>She Capital<\/em><\/strong> came into being. That’s is when I shifted from the entrepreneurial to the VC world.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Q. What are the focus areas of She Capital; are there any specific verticals that you cater to?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A. We don’t have a specific sector focus, because we were already labelled as a company which has narrowed down the focus of their funding&nbsp; to women entrepreneurs. My background being technology for the last 20 years, that is one thing we have stuck with; we fund technology ventures and I also feel, we should only get behind what we can add value to. Broadly we look at consumer tech ventures which are there in the market.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Q. In India, most of the women entrepreneurs are not even aware of any government support schemes and therefore they do not approach for financial support from external institutions – would you blame this on lack of awareness or an inherent reluctance of women to reach out for funds?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A. Surprisingly, it is not just our women entrepreneurs who are unaware about schemes, even if some are and they reach out to the officials for assistance in getting funds, the government officials more often than not, do not have the knowledge about these schemes or the steps required to be taken to take advantage of them. I think the infrastructure and intention are there, but the execution on that has been very weak. Now, however, things are changing – we see Niti Ayog, Invest India, very active in this sphere of work. As far as women entrepreneurs are concerned, even I didn’t know about venture funding – it is a ‘market maturity’ aspect we have to understand. For example, way back in 2007, I didn’t know much, I had very little knowledge - now, over the years I have learnt. Now many women are very aware about how to raise funding, they know exactly what the investors are looking for. However, even today, they are not as sophisticated as their male counterparts. Their awareness on some levels like how to show your financial projections and so on, needs to be enhanced. However, once women get the knack of it, achieving the sophistication of presentations and projections, there will be no looking back for them.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Q. Do you get enquiries from women beyond the Tier 1 cities; women entrepreneurs residing in smaller cities?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A. Yes, in fact it amazes me to see the level of sophistication or researched knowledge some of them have. Today, there are some really upbeat business ventures being built in tier 2 cities. And the biggest difference between a female founder and male founder where financial projections are concerned, is that,&nbsp; a woman led company will always focus on the realistic side. However, going beyond realism, &nbsp;having that grand idea and aspiring towards it should also be there, which women don’t tend to do! This is the only thing women need to do, especially women entrepreneurs coming from tier 2 cities. They are more humble in terms of financial projections and growth, which one on hand is appreciable as it is a very realistic approach; but on the other hand, you have to be able to look beyond and see the bigger picture on the scale; today, that is imperative. Before you approach investors I would request all female business founders to study your business plan really well, &nbsp;be realistic but also think about how you can be a part of the bigger picture, and&nbsp; aim towards more growth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Q. What are some of the tips you wish to give women entrepreneurs who are looking for generating investments for their business ventures?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A. The first advice would be to do extensive research and then send out your email when approaching an investor. If you are going to an incubator it is different but if you are going to a venture stage investor or an angel investor, have your deck in place, because we are not going to hand-hold you through your journey. Do not send out a small email with nothing in it for the investor to understand, because the first thought any investor would have is that if you, as an entrepreneur do not have the enthusiasm or energy to talk about your idea, why would we believe that you would have the energy to take it forward after we invest in it! Also, research investors – not all investors invest in all types of business models. This is the kind of homework that needs to be done. Secondly, a humble request to all female entrepreneurs is to know your numbers and do not shy away from them. Numbers are the backbone of any business and if you understand business, you will know your numbers and you should talk about it or else the investor feels you are not comfortable. If to begin with, you aren’t comfortable, then how will you lead the company? &nbsp;Other than that, in general you should be able to answer questions around your business and communicate with clarity. One of the things I request people to do is to start networking early, reach out to people to get more advice and be visible online. This should be done when you are just starting to grow and not looking for funding. At the end of the day, it should be understood that an investor is putting money into your business and the only reason they are going to do that is when they have confidence in you as a founder. If you manage to build this relationship with them right from the beginning they will be more positive in their approach towards either investing in your venture or referring you to other investors.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Q. In India, most of the women enlisted as ‘co-founders’ are actually sleeping-partners; at She Capital, how do you find out if the business is really led by a woman?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A. I don’t think people need to worry about that, one can tell who is in-charge of the business in question. I invest because of the passion that I see in the founder, and I want to see reflections of myself in that person. If somebody is a sleeping partner, they are not going to have that passion. The reason you are investing in the business at an early stage is because you can see the passion in the founder and know what they can make happen in future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Q. You have been talking about mentoring women entrepreneurs for a long time now. So how important do you feel is mentorship, especially for a woman entrepreneur?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A. There are studies that show that if a male and female are equally successful, a female will attribute it 70% more to the mentors who have mentored her and her support network. It is a very important aspect for female founders. That been said, I have over the years seen that the word ‘mentor’ has become slandered – people don’t understand it. I would say, you don’t have to reach out to big names for mentorship, mentors come in all shapes and forms. I don’t have a single person as a mentor, I had different people who have been mentors to me. I think this is the way we impact others, especially women on other women. We can all be mentors to each other. Senior female entrepreneurs can share their learnings with the beginners and this can lead to much peer-to-peer learning as well. Right now it is important that we realize that anyone, even your friend who has the expertise or knowledge can be your mentor. So, when I talk about financial projections, if there is a woman who knows how to do a financial projection, she should look ahead towards trying to mentor more women and give back to the ecosystem which we all belong to.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Q. During the ongoing pandemic, work-from-home has become a reality and ideally, women entrepreneurship should grow in this situation, but the pressures of work have also increased because of working from home. So how has the situation been for you and women entrepreneurs in general according to you?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A. It is a myth I wish to bust! I came across many male colleagues and the press who said that work-from-home is going to help women and I wished to get a reality check on this. I put in a LinkedIn post asking female founders what they felt about the same. Not surprisingly, around 68% women said that work from home is tough – and I am included in it! Our personal and professional lives have merged into one, making it extremely difficult for us. The workload on women has immensely increased and I think the jury is still contemplating on whether work from home has been a positive step for women or not. I would be happy for the situation to go back to normal.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Q. &nbsp;In 2021, with virtual becoming the new reality, do you see any emerging sectors which will create new avenues for women entrepreneurs?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A. EdTech for one, is going through a weird bull-market, never seen before. I think Covid19 has escalated its valuation but personally, I feel the importance we are attributing to EdTech is beyond what was due. I am excited for the number of consumer-tech companies coming through, as it is making life so convenient. Health -tech is another sector which is developing fast and the benefits of it are available for all to reap. For example, the mental-wellness programs have really worked wonders for everyone during the pandemic. Finally, I am seeing many initiatives being taken for women, which weren’t there previously. It is heartening to see so many initiatives and products being built by women and for women – for example so many consumer tech companies are going ahead with these initiatives which give women the opportunity to emerge and excel. Previously the approach was ‘one size fits all’, and females were left with limited opportunities. However, now be it underclothing for women or wellness promoting pills, women have a wide range of choices to select from. I think all this, driven by technology will take precedence and I am very happy to be a part of it in a way.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Q. What can be done to improve the overall entrepreneurship ecosystem in India so that women not only can start ventures but aim to scale them as well?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A. I think 2021 is going to be great year for women, followed by 2022, which will be even better. I have been in the industry for quite some time now, and in comparison to say 2015, now the number of focused women incubators have escalated. Also, podcasts like <strong><em>She Diaries<\/em><\/strong> are providing a great way of knowledge sharing, thereby enabling peer-to-peer learning. Thus, I feel the ecosystem is developing just as is required and there is a lot of activity going on. While some start-ups may take off or some may fade away, the initial initiative coming from women, shows that the ecosystem is maturing. &nbsp;I think we will have the perfectly conditioned ecosystem for women entrepreneurs in 2021.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

      "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Keeping abreast of change –<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Over the years, businesses have strived to keep tabs of the very dynamic market and  today, when the world is gearing up to adopt the  post-COVID19 normalcy, it is essential that businesses should adapt to the changes in order to stay abreast with the changing times and thrive. One change which is permanent and here to stay, albeit in variations, is the adoption of technology. According to <strong>Tuhina Pandey, Communications lead in IBM India and South Asia,  “We are living in a digitally flat world where space and time do not matter anymore – the digital divide has been bridged.”<\/strong>  In tandem with this, I wish to emphasize that the  adoption of technology is being seen as the ‘mother trend’ giving birth to various new trends for us to adopt if we wish to deal with the competitive nature of the market. What is immensely heartening is the view of <strong>Sanjeeva Shivesh, Founder &amp; CEO, The Enentrepreneurship School<\/strong> who says with regards to technology adoption by women that, <strong>“It’s not a technical challenge as India is producing maximum women engineers. So, it’s not a challenge as most people think, and I keep meeting women who are great with technology.” <\/strong>In support of this view, <strong>Jahnabi Phookan, National President of FICCI Ladies Organization (FLO) says, “… this pandemic has boosted the digital revolution in India which could act as a highly profitable domain for women entrepreneurs in the near future as it has already helped them to sustain their businesses in such harsh times.” <\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Looking out for business trends for more visibility -<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As the economy has begun to roll on after a re-boot, significant changes owing to  customer needs have been trending. COVID-19 has brought in a new normal, where <strong>work-from-home<\/strong> (anywhere) is commonly accepted. It has liberated people from traditional norms and ideas that, only working from office yields higher productivity, builds the desired corporate culture, and aids in the overall development of business. The trend of working-from-home has led to localisation, creating innumerable opportunities and women are best placed to exploit these opportunities!  This inferred, <strong>Sanjeeva Shivesh, Founder &amp; CEO, The Enentrepreneurship School claims, “I am sure WFH is going to usher in a golden era of entrepreneurship. The next 3-4 years are going to be a wave of super entrepreneurship!”  <\/strong>Also, the <strong>growth of a hybrid workspace and culture<\/strong>  has allowed the entire ecosystem to function, while alongside granting almost everyone the comfort and flexibility of working from ‘anywhere’. This agile system of work is a trend we would not wish to let go of easily. This shift is a fine balance between work from home and work from office premises and this will lead to reduced travel costs, more virtual interactions and  lesser physical contact.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Again, &nbsp;<strong>Cloud Computing<\/strong> has become an indispensable part of businesses as remote work and Gen Alpha technologies resulting in creation of digital business and&nbsp; the AI era have become a reality. As a matter of fact, looking at the year gone by, the growth of tech trends such as <strong>AI, ML and data analytics<\/strong> is certain in 2021.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The shift to Cloud has been real, rapid and perhaps permanent.<\/strong> One of the business features which was unveiled during the pandemic, was the advantage of a distributed set-up. Tech savvy companies which have been successful in adopting cloud and seamlessly handle data and projects are clear winners in the pandemic time; conveying an obvious message to all other companies to get rid of their scepticism in the adoption of cloud.&nbsp; Cloud investments will be inevitable and huge in the future and so now is the time to make the ‘big shift’, if you already haven’t!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, <strong>businesses have been swift in adopting technology and automation<\/strong> as an integral part of their systems as it has become viable and necessary; one of their smartest moves in the new normal!   The changes caused by COVID-19 have already reshaped the work ecosystem and the use of machines to boost efficiency in business practices and also to keep associates safe, is the way ahead. In support of accepting technology and automation,  <strong>Jenny Sarang, Co-founder and coach at  MyJen.ai,<\/strong> says<strong>, “ Companies are starting to get more comfortable with virtual training.”<\/strong>  AI supported innovations aiding in the supply-chain systems, managing communication and transportations is what the world is bracing for. Easy to integrate automation tools are  helping entrepreneurs to interact with consumers, bill and deliver to clients without constantly being present  at their computers. Chatbots are making online interactions less tedious and more appropriate and quick. Undoubtedly, automation is saving time, money and physical efforts, thereby making it a feature which is here to stay!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Furthermore, &nbsp;the <strong>quick adoption of online, contact-less payment methods <\/strong>has ‘saved the day’ for many enterprises, especially SMEs.

Limited interaction with consumers and workers, will push us towards adoption of platforms supported by AI to be able to interact, produce and deliver products in time.&nbsp; This trend is undoubtedly a more proactive approach to do business – and that is definitely the future. However, considering that all opportunities bring along challenges and vice-versa, while leveraging the opportunities created, we should be equipped to manoeuvre the challenges as well.

Shammi worked across technology, infrastructure sectors and offshoring services and Jenny is an expert in corporate and executive coaching. Their interview features in She Diaries, under the under the banner – HT Smart Cart.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In this dialogue, they share their early beginnings, important skills that play a critical role in setting up an entrepreneurship, tips for students, who are on the threshold of starting a career, women entrepreneurs setting out and more…<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. Both of you have worked for GE, so, was it then that you came up with the idea of setting up your own venture - how did it all begin? It would be good to know about your journey.<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shammi:<\/strong> The genesis began way back when Jenny and I used to share a cabin at GE. Jenny was leading the leadership practice for GE’s ACFC – the customer programme and I was heading the Six Sigma practice. Both of us would work with GE’s top customers and suppliers which were all the big corporate houses in India, like the Tata Group, Jindal Group and Reliance Group. And, what I used to enjoy the most was having those conversations at the end of the day with Jenny, where I would talk about my clients, the challenges we are facing, how Six Sigma helps and doesn’t help; Jenny would talk about her accounts and we would invariably end up discussing how leadership skills, soft skills and communication skills your ability to be empathetic, analytical – how all this, at the end of the day, define a successful business,&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, no matter if you’re working with a power plant or a software company (like we were working with TCS &amp; Polaris) or a pharmaceutical company or a manufacturing company, it invariably boils down to what really drives business outcomes and makes business grow. Our conversations were very powerful and we remained friends over the years. From GE she went to set up her own training and consulting business and I went and worked with organizations like Accenture, HCL, WNS in the digital transformation space. Last year, we got back together and it was like fate brought us together for I was in Bangalore and moved back to Delhi. I was telling her about all the exciting things happening in Artificial Intelligence (AI) as I was working with Accenture as VP, RPA &amp; AI, and we realised there is tremendous opportunity for creating a scalable, affordable, personalised coaching solution.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I would joke with Jenny that if there was a way, I would mirror your brain and make thousands of small coaches and pass them on to my team! We all need coaching. For example, just before a difficult negotiation with a customer just after I received a nasty email from a customer, it was a question of – how do I respond or how do I make sure, I don’t react badly? Or how do I have a different conversation with my manager?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, I think these are defining moments in a person’s career and if at that point of time, you can have a coach help you navigate those moments, it can make a huge difference in how your career progresses. Fortunately, I quit my job and Jenny also did so. We came together and set up the company. It’s been a lot work.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately, we have a strong technology partner to back us and we have created two products today with AI, which coach people on communication skills.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q: In these unprecedented times, what are the changes you are witnessing? What are the companies seeking\/expecting from you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Jenny:<\/strong> Companies are seeking more just-in-time solutions and cost is becoming a big factor. Hence RoI or return on investment on training is a very critical matrix.&nbsp; Companies are starting to get more comfortable with virtual training as well and with AI coaching, and they are wanting more animated solutions that can be available when an employee needs it. That is, holistically blended solutions which are a mix of AI coaching, virtual training and measurement are the need of the day.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. How do you see the current times, particularly in the perspective of digitization and how are new technologies affecting our lives - especially women entrepreneurs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shammi: <\/strong>I think there’s never a better time for women entrepreneurs to jump into this space, because we are living in very exciting times, when it comes to technology and digitization. Let me start by looking at my career. When I started 25 years back, the biggest thing I used to feel as a woman at that point of time, was that the corporate world was primarily a man’s world. I could never break into the proverbial Men’s Club (and for a long time I felt the problem was me!) But then better sense prevailed and I realised that it’s called the Men’s Club because it is meant for men.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, the brilliant thing about technology is that you pick up any sphere of life, as it’s a great leveler. It brings in a lot of transparency and it actually underplays or downplays all the middlemen and all these different clubs because it attaches no value to it!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, I think today, if a woman entrepreneur wants to establish herself as a business woman and network, there are so many technology channels available to do the networking (which are not fortresses like ‘Men’s Clubs’ used to be!). The world today, is more about skills and not ‘you pat my back and I pat yours’ kind of thing. It is more about meritocracy and skills, but I wouldn’t say that there are no challenges for women.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just jump on to the bandwagon – that would be my message for most women listening out there, who want to become entrepreneurs. Technology and digitization are there to enable you completely and empower you.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. When most of the world's population is working from home, what according to you, would be the&nbsp;skills that will play an important role? Also, how will they impact the careers of students, standing at the threshold of their professional lives?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Jenny:<\/strong> 80% of your success in life is based on your communication skill. In fact 70% of workplace mistakes are due to miscommunication. Now you add work-from-home and you have an even bigger challenge! The important skills are communication – including listening, empathy, probably influencing and presentation skills (especially on video now); collaboration is becoming an important skill for everyone.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You mentioned students on the threshold of their professional lives. An interesting statistic is that 78% of jobs go to people with better interpersonal skills than the ones more qualified on paper for the job! As Peter Drucker says, the ability to express oneself is perhaps the most important of all skills a man can possess. And, that’s really my advice to a student. If I were a student, I would be focusing on my body language, my vocal tone, my word power,my inter-personal and English language skills as well, for it’s really the language of business. Focus on the skills you are gaining and it will take you further when you have to pivot and change careers down the road.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In fact, it is very important to have a network of women. Even though Shammi and I worked together more than 10 years ago, we stayed in touch and I have a network of other women, who I have worked with in my career and stayed in touch. &nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. What have your experiences in running an AI based company been like? Also, how do you see AI and other technologies contributing to the Human Resource Dept. in the future?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shammi:<\/strong> I think it has just begun and there’s more to come. Especially if you look at AI in HR, there is so much opportunity from looking at how you filter talent at the time of interviewing to how you conduct the whole interview. Now if you look at it as one of the biggest challenges, and it’s really about helping people upskill and re-skill in the right manner. To do that, you need to know detailed training gaps, assessments and this is a very manual and tedious process especially in a large organization. It becomes quite a nightmare! Now AI can play a very critical role because it is intelligent technology. AI is Artificial Intelligence and it can give you customized assessments, depending on the person you need to assess. Each one of us is different, so having standardized assessment never works. And, it will be digital, which is so much faster. You will be able to create an individualized heat map of upskilling and re-skilling. Now, can you imagine what a big impact that will have on your business outcomes!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In my experience of setting up a company, there are many aspects. There is product development, the legal angle, the financial angle. I will talk a bit about product development, which is most critical – to get the solutions of your product right! Collecting the right amount of data, testing it on your algorithms and checking if it’s going to work or not. Defining the problem you are trying to solve is very critical, before you realize it’s not working and you’ve invested too much money – you should not have the ingredients for the wrong recipe! It’s much better that you know it upfront and even if you start slow, it’s better you take time and get your solution right! Also, do reach out to experts all over the world – we did that!!&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. Please share some valuable advice for aspiring women entrepreneurs.<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shammi: <\/strong>It’s a roller-coaster ride. Entrepreneurship is not meant for everybody. Let me start by saying you have to be very sure that this is what you want to do. It’s pretty lonely and there are days when you will have no idea what will happen next, especially in the early days, when you are still solutionizing your product. Days, when you are trying to create that vision and fructify it to something tangible (which may not happen) and there may be days, when you will fail miserably. But, one day your product will be ready, when you will be able to give an amazing demonstration to one of your clients and he will congratulate you for being the first one to do it, and then, everything will pale in comparison!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You have to be self-driven, motivated and you have to believe in yourself essentially.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Build resilience in yourself. Being resilient is visualization. Practise visualization and by design, the universe will engineer that, till it becomes a reality!!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Jenny:<\/strong> Find a partner with complementary skills. Shammi and I are both different and are quite opposites, but that is the strength of our partnership. Strengthen each other. Be passionate and persistent!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

      "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An entrepreneur, a technology journalist, a business media presenter, a corporate communications leader and more - all rolled into one, Tuhina Pandey, Communications lead in IBM India and South Asia, will be sharing her journey of success with Poonam Sinha.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>1 How do you see women entrepreneurs in the unprecedented situation created by COVID-19. Also, what role can technology play to help them move ahead?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>T.P - I perceive the present situation as a very interesting one; there are plenty opportunities waiting to be leveraged. We are living in a digitally flat world where space and time do not matter anymore - the digital divide has been bridged. Technology is a big enabler of inclusion and diversity and businesses can be built out in many sectors. This is where I see the opportunity. According to a recent report, hiring of women has increased by 7% in the COVID-19 period. This itself proves how beneficial this period has been for women. Therefore COVID-19 has just reiterated the fact that in this digital world, women have a bigger role to play and greater opportunities to tap in. Now is the time when the power of technology should be harnessed in order to ride towards a better tomorrow.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2. What does the post-COVID world look like to you, especially for working women?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>T.P. - As I said, COVID19 has opened many doors; there are numerous opportunities but you need to be relevant and digitally equipped. Having a 'digital first' attitude will stand you in good stead.&nbsp; If you are passionate and confident about rolling out your business model, are prepared to juggle and&nbsp; balance work and home responsibilities, NOW is the time to take the plunge! The time is right for women to move ahead as the boundaries between work-from-home and work-for-home have been shattered - you can do so much together. Today, in the post-COVID world, realities have changed and so have are priorities; healthcare, mental well-being, re-skilling\/up-skilling have become imperative. Again, this shift in human behaviour has created many opportunities for all. Given the digital landscape, women can progress in leaps and bounds and build business models to cater to the new-found needs of the society.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>3. What do you think working women should consider while building their own brand?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>T.P. - Purpose is key! One needs to be clear about what is her objective; what does she aim to achieve through her business model. Knowing self-substance and value and reflecting the same in your work is essential. &nbsp;Also, one should be aware of the image of herself, her brand, which she wishes to create for her stakeholder\/ clients to perceive. Clarity along these lines should be of utmost priority before she can come to think of 'how' to build her brand! Again, once the brand has been established with a certain promise, it is imperative that you do fulfil the brand promise; any gaps between your promise and deliverance will mar your brand image. It is advisable that you should choose your sector of work as you cannot be omnipresent. Less is more and thus, intelligent choices regarding 'where' and 'who' do you wish to engage in business with, will prove beneficial for you. Furthermore, inspire others, who have experienced your brand, its promise and delivery, to speak for you - let your work do the talking. It is a matter of pride when your clients\/stakeholders vouch for your authenticity and credibility. So, I think considering these &nbsp;factors and working in accordance with them, will help you to anchor your brand in solid grounds.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>4. What advise will you dispense for working women - what are the top three skills that will matter in the decade ahead?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>T.P. - &nbsp;&nbsp;Digital acceleration in our nation had begun a long time ago but the reality of today is that we are witnessing a digital revolution at an extremely high pace! Due to this there has been exponential growth. So having a 'digital first' attitude is a must; but this attitude has to enable you to see things more concretely; for example you should be able to identify what are the digital work models that can work, how can you build a digital workforce, how can you use technology which will support your business model, what are your digital skills - marketing, communications, content strategy, what are your digital ethics - all these need to be considered in depth if you want a sustainable business model today. Also, being agile is crucial, as speed can be your differentiator. With the changing lifestyles, the needs of the society and economy are changing - what was relevant yesterday may not be so today. Further, you must 'learn to learn' - this will help you to adapt and adopt the changes which are taking place at an alarming speed.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>5. Talking about your personal journey, how did you manage to reinvent and stay relevant in an unconventional career throughout?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>T.P. - I see life as a platform to experiment, an opportunity to be bold while we live its full potential. Personally, for me it has been about connecting the dots, learning on the job and then applying those skills-set to the next challenge or opportunity in another job landscape. Eventually through all my professional endeavours, I have only connected the dots, and it has worked out perfectly for me. In everything I do, I use my knowledge from other projects as well. Therefore in looking at life as full of experiments, I constantly reinvented myself and stayed relevant.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>6. Did you find any support network - how? Did it help in shaping your career in any way?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>T.P. - We live with many stereotypes and pre-established societal templates and it all comes from your inter-grinding of culture over a period of time. As women we tend to be sole warriors in many ways but we have a lot to learn from our male counterparts in that regard. So networking, sisterhood, building a strong community support system around us is absolutely critical. I did not start off with everything great but eventually some of the biggest collaborators, supporters and people who I look up to - both women and men, have guided me.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having spent my foundation years in Kolkata, I have largely been influenced by the works of Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and Swami Vivekananda; their efforts to improve the status of women in society. It takes an entire community to come together to triumph over social evils and stereotypes that women have lived with far too long now. It is a long journey, and still, we do have miles to go because there still exists a clear discrepancy between the size of the male and female professional workforce in India. I think, now, is an opportunity for all of us to be the change we expect to see.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>7. What makes women successful as entrepreneurs and what makes women, especially in India let go of their careers midway?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>T.P.- &nbsp;A woman entrepreneur can be successful only when she believes in herself. Also, women should not be very harsh on themselves. That is, according to a recent study, unlike men, women do not apply for jobs with which their profiles do not match a 100%. However, believing in yourself and experimenting is the way ahead for women who wish to succeed as entrepreneurs - after all one can always learn on the job as well. It depends upon us to set examples for other women to follow and tide over their apprehensions. &nbsp;I would say, it is not about 'the best talent winning' it is more about, 'the most persistent talent winning!' Many talented women give up their career as many Indian women suffer from the 'super-woman' syndrome, where they want to do everything perfectly in trying to please everybody in the family. In the process, I feel they forget to love themselves! A wee bit of self-love and ambition has to be there - it is about how persistent you are, which makes a lot of difference. Here both, society and technology have a crucial role to play - if we want more women to step out and carve an identity for themselves, then we need to create a support system, embedded with technology access for enabling women to work from anywhere and anytime. In this context, the rise of Gig economy is the trigger which will help women become professionally more relevant, owing to the flexibility it will provide.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>8. How do you think women can leverage the power of communication to succeed at either our own venture or in a shared work space?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>T.P. - Communication is a very powerful and magical tool - it can change and re-define. It is a tool used by personas who initiated change; whether it is Martin Luther King or&nbsp; Mahatma Gandhi, they all communicated to bring about revolutionary changes. Again, it is obvious that views will be criticized as well but you have to have the resilience to stand up for them. If you want to circulate your ideas in the market, you have to lend your voice to it. However, while utilizing communication as a 'power' tool you must remember that it just doesn’t end with you, it has to be powerful enough to reach your audience and convince them, therefore humility and clarity in communication is extremely important. Thus, communicating and understanding your stakeholders ideas and needs is of utmost importance as it is what adds up to make you a powerful communicator. Besides, you have to be authentic and consistent as a communicator because your actions must always be in tandem with your words. Communication is the foundational rock on which the society is built, so communicate, communicate, communicate!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>9. &nbsp;What has given you more satisfaction, being an entrepreneur or being a professional? Also, what skills helped you to succeed in one sphere of work but did not matter in the other sphere of work?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>T.P.- When you are an entrepreneur, you are an employment generator, therefore every action you take, every decision you make, has an impact on your employees, their families, in some way or the other. Thus, being an entrepreneur comes with greater responsibility. However, on the flip side, as an entrepreneur you have more flexibility to define and shape things your way, define many careers and reap the benefits of your hard work to the fullest. It is a high risk - high reward undertaking and is extremely purposeful. As an entrepreneur you have to wear multiple hats because you are a part of sales, marketing, your brand's reputation and everything and anything else too! Personally, I have never stopped being an entrepreneur even in my professional life; I have taken up every role, every opportunity with the same spirit. We take risks, push the boundaries in being either a professional or an entrepreneur and I have always tried to guide, motivate and mentor my team with the same entrepreneurial spirit, treating each professional achievement as a personal win. To me every role begins with the positive thought of ' I AM POSSIBLE' as the word 'impossible' does not exist for me!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>10. If you had to give one advice to aspiring women entrepreneurs, what would that be?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>T.P.-&nbsp; Be Bold and Dream Big - You do not know what possibilities lie ahead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

This podcast is under the banner - HT Smartcast.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here, you can catch Ms Ruby Sinha, Managing Director- Kommune Brand Communications and Founder- sheatwork.com in a conversation with Ms Noopur Jhunjhunwalla, Monitoring, Evaluation and Partnership Lead, UN Women (India Office).<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: In tune with your experience of working with women globally, what are your views on women empowerment?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>NJ:<\/strong> Women entrepreneurship is critical for gender equality, without it we can’t achieve gender equality. We must be cognizant of the fact that this is a very important year for us as it marks 25 years to the Beijing&nbsp;&nbsp; platform for action, which is the first time the world came together to commit to gender equality and women empowerment. It was the first time that we vocalized and accepted women rights. We still have a large gender gap in the world. 1 in 3 women still continues to experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime; on an average 137 women are killed by a member of their own family every day;&nbsp; in 18 countries, husbands can legally prevent their wives from working and in 39 countries daughters and sons don’t have equal inheritance rights. So on an average women earn 20% less than their male counterparts and only 6% make it to an executive role.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have made a lot of progress, but there is still so much left to do. There is not a single country in the world that can claim to be gender-equal today. We are taking steps, but the pace is slow and we need to accelerate it forward. The next generation is the generation for equality; that’s what they demand and we should be enabling that!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: Those are grim figures that you’re portraying for us. How important is the role of various stakeholders in creating a robust ecosystem for women entrepreneurship?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>NJ:<\/strong> It’s absolutely critical. India is, for example, legislatively a very progressive state but our gender stereotype is deeply engrained in our being and normalized every day that it’s really about that behavioural change. It’s about you and me walking in our own little silos; we must work together collectively, whether it’s for women or women entrepreneurship.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Recently, there have been a number of studies on the impact of COVID-19 on women-owned businesses. A recent study by us at UN Women has highlighted that women are asking for this holistic approach – they need access to finance, to investments, contract opportunities, business training, mentorship and networking. These are very critical for them and we can see a lot of gaps within the eco-system. If you look at the financial structure, a recent IFC report on female-led startups or any organization with 1 female founder is likely to get disproportionately small amount of global venture funds. In 2018 it was reported that only 11% of seed funding and 5% of late-stage venture funding in engaging markets went to women. This is a bit scary, because we know from experience and many studies that women are prudent with money and tend to create better profit and returns on investment. Globally, public procurement spending generates 15 to 30% of the GDP of a country and, only 1% goes to women! So, we know that 34% of companies that have diversified supply chains actually create positive impact of their profitability; and in fact, in 2014, AT&amp;T attributed 4 billion of their revenue to engage women suppliers. It’s not that you want to work with women because it’s a feel-good thing; it actually makes good business sense! And, that’s why the whole eco-system needs to work – whether it’s your investors, venture capitalists, angel investors, accelerators and incubators who are helping; whether it is the banking system or the Mudra loans that the government is promoting. When you go to the ground, the manager will still need those extra documents for a woman. Recently, we had a case when 2 founders of a women-run entrepreneurship (they owned the land and the business was in their name) and when they wanted a loan for COVID-related expansion, and approached a bank, under the Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme, the manager refused, saying that it would not be possible unless they got an NOC from their husbands! This is not a requirement.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s really not about just addressing the gaps, but it has to be an eco-system approach, where we work with multiple people across the board, with various stakeholder groups and bridge those gaps, which are often soft – it’s informational, biases, or lack of access! We are seeing that more and more investors interested in diversifying their portfolios are looking for women to invest in. And, yet when we talk to women, they say that investors are not interested in their ideas because they don’t think that it’s commercially viable. So, we are working towards bridging this gap as well – to enable a woman to pitch better for an investor.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We also see biases – a lead woman VC told us that while making a pitch people don’t look at her in the eye, but focus on her colleagues who are junior, because they don’t think that she is in the decision –making role! That is unfortunate! We would expect these biases not to exist, but this runs deep across the strata of society. That’s what is required when you look at the eco-system approach.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS: Women’s economic empowerment plays a key role in achieving gender equality and contributes to overall economy also. What are some of the measures taken by UN Women to help women achieve economic empowerment, especially in terms of women entrepreneurship in India?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>NJ:<\/strong> <em>According to McKinsey's&nbsp;<\/em><em>global study, $12 trillion can be added to global economy by 2025 , by advancing women equality. When we are in this downturn, it’s also necessary that women become a part of that recovery and are not further marginalized. At UN Women, we work across areas of women economic empowerment, where we look at a holistic perspective. It’s not about skill training, it’s also about addressing issues of violence, mentoring and leadership roles that organisations can take and it’s also about enabling behavioral change and breaking stereotypes. We have a few programmes which are quite strong that we are working on. Globally UN Women has come up with 7 women empowerment principles which are the guidelines or a framework for an organization to become gender equal. It ra<\/em><em>nges from how to get diversity <\/em><em>at the workforce, how to create more equal supply chains to the way we are designing our products and dealing with safety. We are working closely with the private sector on adopting these principles. &nbsp;We have many organizations that have signed up like – Biocon, Tata Power, Campgemini – to name a few. <\/em><em><\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>We also have a programme called the ‘Second Chance Education Program’ where we work with rural enterprises in Rural India across 4 states with women, who have dropped out of the education system for various social reasons like early marriage, lack o<\/em><em>f resources and, now they want <\/em><em>to get back to the workforce. We are working to complete their education, to skill them and also help them build their enterprise. Recently S<\/em><em>BI and the World Bank announced<\/em><em> a scheme for women livelihood, where we are seeing a lot of women are transitioning from self-help groups to scale into individual enterprises that require Rs 10 lakh loans. So a special scheme that will give competitive interest rate based loans to women, who can grow their businesses is critical. It’s a missing middle now. <\/em><em><\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Moreover, we have an investor consortium along with our sister agency UNTP and NITI Aayog. The consortium consists of investors who invest in various stages – from angel to debt, and we work with women and train them to make successful pitches to investors. We have been doing this for over a year now and we are seeing great results!<\/em><em><\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>And, we are doing innovative stuff like the Industry Disrupter Challenge and recently had Sri Shakti Challenge with the government of India, where women can innovate and find solutions to challenges posed to them. In the Disrupter Challenge, it was focused on sustainable fashion and we created a linkage between women entrepreneurs and the industry which included names like H&amp;M, who incidentally are working with a large % of women entrepreneurs and their feedback have led to solutions that they been struggling with. We didn’t realise that there is so much innovation out there! <\/em><em><\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>It’s critical we work on an intersectional, innovative approach. So, where we work with women, we also <\/em><em>deal with how they work around <\/em><em>their household burden. <\/em><em><\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS:<em> In the current scenario, the WFH reality is coming across as the new normal, so will there be a growth of women entrepreneurship, because now she can sit at home and run her business?<\/em><em><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>NJ:<\/strong> <em>I think it’s a double-edged sword. Technology has provided a lot of opportunities to join the workforce and scale business too. A recent study says that women are facing many challenges from the WFH mode, because they don’t have the tech knowhow, as almost 60% told us. Almost 51% reported that the household routine has been affecting productivity of women employees and 70% had to quit because dealing with children and husband’s schedules came in the way, and added to this were old parents and the elderly who needed care. <\/em><em><\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>On the flip side, 70% said that they are getting some sort of support from the social support system – from friends, family, advisors, mentors – on how to run their business in the pandemic. Yet, the number of people who reported this was very minimal. So, we have this deep-seated patriarchy in our society, where it’s ok for women to work, but she also has to take care of all household work! That is a challenge, but it is an opportunity to change this as well! We are seeing more home-run businesses getting access to e-commerce, and they are growing. Many e-commerce companies have told us that this has given opportunitie<\/em><em>s to hire women in Tier 3 and 4<\/em><em> cities with lower cost and higher productivity, which otherwise they would not have been able to do. They are able to use technology to deliver their back-office operations as well – inventory management, cataloging etc; they are also seeing ne distribution models emerging. We need to be cognizant of the risks – there are stories of violence and pressures. Since it’s new, we need to develop a protocol in place as well. These complexities will resolve but it’s a great opportunity for women who have been dropping out of the eco-system. <\/em><em><\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>RS:<em> It’s more ‘worklife integration’ than ‘worklife balance’. In this context, what are the biggest challenges for women entrepreneurs? <\/em><em><\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>NJ:<\/strong> <em>I think it’s clearly that women are asking for support in terms of market linkages and technology – multiple studies have shown us this. 75% reported women are looking for new business opportunities. To me it gives hope – women are not giving up, and they are still committed and we should empower that. <\/em><em><\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Talking of the eco-system, we are all adapting to a new normal, which opens up an opportunity. Whether it is technical linkage to work from home, or e-supply chain or e-commerce set up, or mentoring – there are many ways to do it.

      "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In believing that agriculture, is a wise pusuit, as it contributes most to attaining ‘real’ wealth, good morals and happiness, PRIYA PANDEY, rolled out her venture,  Agrifeeder Agricultral Services Pvt. Ltd. While in conversation with POONAM SINHA, she  gives  us a glimpse of her entrepreneurial journey, dotted with  ups and downs and finally exuberates over her victory in all humility.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q.<\/strong> How did you decide on venturing out into becoming an entrepreneur and what was the infrastructure available?<br><br><strong>A.<\/strong> There are a host of reasons why I chose to become an entrepreneur over the more traditional choice of becoming an employee. My creativity was perhaps not cut out for the limitations of corporate life. I wanted a lifestyle that isn’t bound  nine to five. Yes indeed, entrepreneurship gives me the freedom and flexibility I need, in order to work constructively. I sometimes need to work way beyond 'nine to five' in order to achieve what I want. So it is not about wanting a shortcut, it is just the wish and will to work as and when needed. It is hard work but with that effort comes the ability to shape your life how you wish to  see it. Furthermore, I always thought unconventionally. This said, in tandem with Albert Einstein's statement,\" Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere,” encouraged me to bring my unconventional ideas to a consequence - therefore entrepreneurship it was!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;Again, being passionate about learning, propelled my desire to be an entrepreneur as I feel that entrepreneurs are never satiated with the knowledge they have -- they are always seeking more. Many people equate age, status or certain achievements with the end of their&nbsp;education, but according to me, to learn is to be alive; and so, the best reason to start an organization was to learn and&nbsp; do practical, meaningful work --&nbsp;to create a product or service to make the world a better place. I want to change the world and in doing so I knew, I had to sail away from the safe harbor, dream and discover.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q.<\/strong> Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you and how did you handle competition?<br><strong>A.<\/strong>  The first challenge was to convince my parents about the aptness of my decision of coming   back from Bangalore, to start a business in  Bihar. The safety factor,  the risk of loss, every aspect was explained to them in details in order to win over their support.  I also  told them about  the success stories of  other women entrepreneurs  from Bihar, like,  Usha Jha ma’am, Himani Mishra, Anukriti and many more. This done, the second challenge was handling the societal pressure;  people had begun to question  my parents. They were bombarded with a series of ‘why’s.. why did  I leave my job, why after completing  MBA, I had opted for an entrepreneurial journey  in the  agriculture sector, why did I want to sell tea!!  However,  when your family is   supportive, society takes a back seat.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The third challenge was navigating through the &nbsp;environment here, which &nbsp;is totally different in comparison to the metro cities. People are complacent; they are happy in their comfort zone and&nbsp; no one is ready to adopt technology, and progress.&nbsp; Everyone wants to follow the same tradition which was there 20years back.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I handled &nbsp;these challenges with patience, &nbsp;each time my actions were questioned, they were replied to with my success and achievements.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q.<\/strong>  What business types do you think have scope for growth in rural areas and how optimally are local resources used in rural entrepreneurial ventures?<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>A.<\/strong> In rural areas small scale business have good scope of growth in a country like ours. Agri based business like food processing units for the production of ready to eat products, vegetables, poultry, fisheries, dairy farms and so on  have much scope for growth in rural areas as  these products  are in demand in the urban markets. You can take Agrifeeder's Lemongrass Herbal Tea as an example. We  started from a very small village (Dubouli) in Bhagalpur District of Bihar, and adopting social media as a marketing platform, we have supplied the product from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and the feedback is amazing.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q.<\/strong> Are you being supported by  any government initiative designed to promote rural entrepreneurship? What kind of support would you want from the local panchaayat body\/ government to further boost rural entrepreneurship?<br><strong>A.<\/strong>  When I started out in 2017, the State Government had   launched the  Bihar Startup Policy-2017 and we were fortunate to have gotten  selected as a potential startup.  We got incubation and were also selected to get seed fund from Department of Industry, Govt of Bihar. However,  what I have realized over these few years  is that an incubation centre should be setup at every panchayat level in  Bihar. This will help  home based 'she'preneurs by providing them with the guidance they need to take their businesses to the next level. I wish to request that government officials should not be involved in this.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q.<\/strong>  Any tips for women in rural areas who wish to become entrepreneurs?<br><strong>A.<\/strong>  Yes I have few tips which I have learnt. I think women entrepreneurs should not be afraid of failures as they march ahead. They must strive to keep learning, create a strong network of people who may aid them in their endeavours and surely keep away from all and any negativities in any form!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

One of the names synonymous with women empowerment is that of the\nNational President of FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO), Jahnabi Phookan. &nbsp;As Poonam Sinha, delves deeper into her\nachievements as a woman entrepreneur and FLO President, the picture of her\ndedication only becomes more vivid and applause-deserving.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Q1. &nbsp;<strong>You've been a women entrepreneur of more than\none venture for decades now. How did you find your calling? <\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think I was born with the inherent\nthought of empowering women, because I believe women form the backbone of our\nsociety. Again, the Northeast has always remained in my heart and it has\nreflected in my work over the years. So somewhere deep within I knew that I was\nmeant to focus towards establishing new growth avenues for empowering women.\nHowever, in order to empower others, one must first attain the power to do so.\nThis and love for Nature allowed the entrepreneur in me to emerge - thus,\nJungle Travels India (1989) and Assam Bengal Navigation Company (2003) were\nborn. My companies are encompassed in travel and hospitality and once again aid\nin providing livelihoods especially to women and their communities. It also\ngives me great pride in sharing that both the companies have won the\nprestigious National Tourism Award.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Q2. <strong>Congratulations.<\/strong> <strong>You have taken\nover as president of FICCI FLO at a very challenging time.

The study will include their\ncurrent situation, challenges faced by them and recommendations or solutions\nfrom the district level to the union to the government.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q3. Covid-19 has\ncaused all round disruption, with salary cuts, job losses and so on. What\nspecific initiative should be taken to help women workers and entrepreneurs at\nthis time?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The economic\nimpact of this crisis is huge and has hit sectors in big way; it’s going to\nhave a snowballing effect across the length and breadth of economic activities.\nWe at FICCI FLO are in constant touch with relevant government ministries for\nthe skilling and upskilling of the women migrant workers.&nbsp; For an\n‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, it is important to take the women along as they have a\nmajor role in reviving the economy and making India self-reliant. For this, we\nhave created an MSME fund to help women in the micro and small businesses to\ncope and rescue the economy. We are also partnering with many social\nenterprises like Women on Wings to focus on identifying and supporting to work\nprimarily with rural women in sectors such as agriculture, food processing,\neco-tourism, textiles, handicrafts, waste management and non-timber forest\nproducts (NTFP) and related upstream activities and NTFP.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q4. <\/strong><strong>You have done lot\nof work in the North East and also instituted an award--Iconic Women of North\nEast. Do you plan to take some of these initiatives pan India?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yes, certainly it will be FLO’s endeavour to replicate the northeast model pan India. In fact, as mentioned earlier, we are in touch with several states and our chapters are working relentlessly to ensure we give equal opportunities to weavers across nations. We have extended our support to Atmanirbhar Bharat, by launching our support to handloom &amp; make in India.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In NE women are given equal\nopportunities. Our grassroot initiative in Nagaland, 'KONYAK', showcases a\ncurated collection of designs from artisans, across the Northeast. Konyak helps\nartisans and weavers to garner a regular source of income. The platform\neffectively combines the textile initiative with a tourism model making it a\nsuccessful case study that has also been adopted by the state of Meghalaya. In\nAssam, the signature line, 'Tribal Heritage' and 'Lahe Looms' launched by me,\nare small steps to work for the cause of women weavers.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q5.<\/strong><strong> What would be\nyour advice to women entrepreneurs?

      "post_content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"You can cut all flowers, but you cannot\nkeep Spring from coming.\" This quote resonates with the happenings in the\nlife of Mohua Chinappa, a daughter, a wife, a mother, a writer and finally a\nwoman of substance who has travelled through the road not taken and discovered\na new self in the process. Poonam Sinha talks to her about her entrepreneurial\njourney and successes.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q How did you begin your entrepreneurial journey?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A- I have always been an entrepreneur. I\nwould say I was perhaps born with the aptitude to be an entrepreneur, which was\ntapped into a wee bit later in life, changing it into an ability. I say this\nbecause even when I was handling work as an employee, despite that, I was\nALWAYS IN CHARGE! I worked sedulously, as if the business belonged to me and\nany achievement was a personal success for me; although it did take some time\nto recognise this fact about myself, deep within me, I knew, entrepreneurship\nwas my calling.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I believe that every negative occurrence has a positive aspect to it, and about 10 years back, when &nbsp;I was bedridden due to certain ailments, I got the time to introspect and that is when &nbsp;I realised that I wanted to write - write about everything that is not given much importance or &nbsp;voice in the main stream media. I started a blog and I started writing about arts, crafts and for me, the satisfaction it brought is inexplicable, there are no words that can come close to describing its depth. However, it was not until last year that I decided to engage my pen in writing for brands as well, since my blogs were appreciated by many, I began doing content on commission, like brand related content work. I am also launching a podcast in August, 2020, in attempting to bring such people into public eye who have adopted 'different' paths to create a more meaningful life; a life that is not charted out in accordance with set societal norms and etiquette. It will be very inspiring and interesting to know about people &nbsp;&nbsp;who without the fear of being ostracized by the society have dared to differ, have dared to LIVE!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. Tell us something about the challenges faced by you.<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A- Inspite of all the gender bias I grew up\nobserving in our society, I always thought, \"What's not to love about\nbeing a woman?\" However, gradually truth dawned and I understood that the\ngreatest challenge I have to face every day in almost all my endeavours, is that,\nI am a woman. I don’t think a woman is always taken very seriously and adding\nto that, if you are a well-dressed one, you are definitely branded brainless!\nAlso, the cliché thought process of our society has drawn an imaginary line of\nage, as if demarcating the youth and old-age hemispheres in one's life. The\nmoment you are any older than four decades, you are compelled to retire\nmentally and are treated like an invalid, with people offering you special\nprivileges. However, I strongly disagree with this; I am more agile, energetic\nand enthusiastic about my work than many who are perhaps years younger than I\nam. Another hurdle in my path is that people want good content but at a price\nwhich is appallingly abysmal. Negotiating about service charges of writers is\nextremely objectionable and should be done away with.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q.&nbsp; Did you get any support from your family in your endeavour?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A - It actually gives me lot of happiness\nand pride in saying that I have grown career wise without any support.\nTheoretical societal perspectives of the role of a woman in her family are\nideas that have plagued our thought processes from time immemorial. I however,\nwished to create an identity for myself apart from being the daughter, wife and\nmother that I am. It is not as if I had to let go of my familial\nresponsibilities in order to carve out a niche for myself as an entrepreneur;\nit was all about balancing it well. It was a daunting and to a certain extent,\nlonesome journey, but I did thrive.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. How do you feel we can create a more conducive environment for women entrepreneurs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A - I think women have always strived with\na smile and it is time we reaped the fruits of our labour. In saying so, I wish\nto stress upon women being given equal rights as men in our society. A world full\nof empowered women isn't one where men are marginalized. It is a world where\neveryone thrives and I am very hopeful that one day we are going to witness a\nworld where women will be safe and empowered. I think, we have already\ninitiated work towards the creation of such a world. Again, I believe, that\nCOVID-19 indeed has posed many challenges but on the other hand has created so\nmany opportunities as well, especially for women. Today women are working from\nhome and the quality of work has not suffered at all. In fact, the productivity\nlevels have only increased. Thus, by shattering age old myths about women\ninefficiency at work place, their inability to work post marriage and raising\n'feminist men' we are definitely creating a more conducive environment for\nwomen entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. Any words of wisdom for our aspiring women bloggers\/entrepreneurs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A - You need to be passionate and honest\nabout whatever you are writing. Content becomes very alluring when honest women\npresent their views without any inhibitions. I agree that hypocrisy still\nexists in our society but I would advise, best not to resort to it. It is up to\nyou to prove the strength of your pen in trying to eradicate hypocrisy and\nduality and therein accepting your true self. It is heartening to see some women\nalready speaking out their minds. In joining their league, I perceive us as the\ntorch bearers for our women's liberation movement, which has set the ball\nrolling for the creation of a much more adapting and accepting society. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

There is much talk about supporting your\nown tribe, but unfortunately not much action taken in that direction. Women\nstill have to struggle to make their own place in the society. I believe that\nthings would be much easier if we did support each other. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am a firm believer of women empowerment; in\nsaying so, I must clarify that ALL WOMEN ARE EMPOWERED, they simply have to\nchannelize it in the proper way. I have created my own family trust which works\nfor the health and education for the lesser privileged women. We give them job\nopportunities so that they can be financially independent. 60% of these women\nare employed in my stores.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. &nbsp;Give us an insight into your family's role in\nyour success as a woman entrepreneur.

I\ncome from a family of doctors. Education is very important in my family and\nwomen are given equal education just as the men of the house. When I first\ndecided to venture into fashion, it was a surprise for my family. Yet, they\nsupported me and helped me realize my dreams. Each and every woman in my family\nhas been my strength. Also, the men who married into my family believe in\nfemale equality and have supported their partners in their professional\nspheres. This attitude is very important for women entrepreneurs and this is\nwhat helps me balance my personal and professional life with ease.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q.

I have launched 'Toile' in 2017 in India and\nwe have stores in Mumbai and Kolkata. It is India's first sustainable multi designer\nstore. The concept behind this is to provide a platform to emerging or\nwell-established designers working towards sustainable fashion. We work with\nweavers and along with providing employment to these deserving craftsmen, we\nare also trying to revive the handloom industry. In 2020 I am launching the\nthird store in London. Technology will be a great enabler in 2020 and I intend\ngoing ahead with my plans using the e-commerce platform.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. &nbsp;Any words of wisdom for aspiring women\ndesigners?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fashion and Glamour Industry is very\nattractive and addictive. It is very competitive too as we &nbsp;have thousands of designers graduating each\nyear and it becomes difficult to find your feet in the industry. &nbsp;I believe it is always better to intern and\nlearn the trade and then launch your label when you have learnt the ropes.\nThere is no place for mediocrity.

I got to meet a\nfood blogger in a wedding and she was taken up by this idea of going to dine at\nan unknown person's house, when it would be a unique cuisine that they would\nget to sample. So, the food bloggers came,<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>ate and wrote\nabout it on a popular facebook group and people started getting curious about\nthis ‘home dine experience’.

How did you think about becoming an entrepreneur?<br>\n<\/strong>To become an entrepreneur was a bunch of small\nlittle ideas and years of constant learning.

Before I had imagined that the very best\nproduct would get people to automatically buy everything I made, I would have a\nhighly skilled team whom I can boss around, drive around in fancy cars and\nwould be super rich. My after, the very best product in the entire world is not\ngoing to sell for itself, it needs a human to sell it. You have to promote it\nhard enough first that people get to know about it. And with the crowded\noptions in the market, you have to constantly stay in touch with your customers\neven after that and stay innovative. When you do get the stage where you have a\nhighly skilled team, while you are holding them together, it is a combination\nof both their hard work and sweat and yours that has gotten you to the position\nyou're in. So you don't boss around, but help your team up to create greater\nthings together. And when you do find yourself becoming rich, you are so engrossed\nin building an even bigger vision of your idea, that such things don't matter\nanymore. Honestly the joy of building your idea into a viable business\novertakes the happiness you would get about being rich. Entrepreneurial journey\nis a mix of things you love and the things you hate the most in the right\nbalance.<br>\n<br>\n<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. What are some strengths that a woman entrepreneur should possess?<br>\n<\/strong>Being a woman itself is one of our biggest\nstrengths. We have the ability to emotionally connect and it works wonders if\nyou're in the B2B segment. Alongside strengthening your ability to speak about\nmoney (a business however small or big will not work without it) and to say no.\nWe find it overwhelming to talk about money or to say no, cultivate it strongly\ntoday and remember no one will ever judge you for it. As a woman today in\nIndia, there are so many opportunities you could make maximum benefit out of.\nSo, ensure to keep women entrepreneur friends who will uplift and stay\nconnected with you through your entrepreneurial journey and learn from each\nother.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you?<br>\n<\/strong>The biggest responsibility today for us remains to\nbe that of the farmer. He\/she is dependent on us for their livelihood today and\nwill be even tomorrow. The process does not end at us getting them on board.\nEven post that it involves us being able to build that trust they instil in us\nwith utmost confidence. Them delivering consistently to us and us delivering to\nour customers and that further helping us to deliver back to the farmers to\nmaintain their livelihood has been the biggest challenge. This is a long\nprocess that sometimes even takes a year or above to get the farmer to have\ntrust in us thoroughly. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. How do you find competition in your business area?<\/strong><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We got into the\nNiche Cooking Chocolate market at a rather early stage, when competition was\nvery limited. So while we did have the first starter advantage for a very short\nperiod, competition came by quite quickly (especially with the potential this\nmarket held in india). To us competition has been a driving force to stay on\ntop of our game every step of our way. Sometimes, it's also a learning ground\nwhen you are trying something new and see how they did differently and pick up\nfrom their learnings. While we will remain competitors, a couple of us from the\nindustry sit together and see how we can take this market to a greater reach.\nInstead of concentrating on poaching each other's customers, our focus is on\ncreating a larger and newer customer base everyday. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. How did you try to make your business different? <br>\n<\/strong>It's quite simple to make a business different. But\nthe challenging part is to be able to have revenues come in through different\nideas. Our approach on this particular front has been traditional that is a mix\nof constant feedback from customers and creatively ideating. This has helped us\nland in a sweet spot of being different and still a viable running business. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. What are your future plans?<br>\n<\/strong>On a brand front, five years down the lane, I see\nSihi Chocolaterie at a global market with presence in various other countries\noutside India. From an impact point of view, we want to be able to make a\ndifference to at least 5000 or more farming families. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. Any tips for someone starting out today?<br>\n<\/strong>Entrepreneurship is about being a jack of all, but\nfinding a master in every trade. You yourself cannot be a master in everything\nand it is how every entrepreneur is. So overlook only what's important and\nallow others to do their best. Because in your journey, your role is to hold\nmultiple stakeholders together to make your business run like a well oiled\nmachinery. So find the right set of people (both customers and team members),\nwork hard, stay creative and hungry. Most of all stay innovative in your approach\nbecause your situation will not change until you change it. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

I have helped professionals\nto understand their core strengths which empowered them to make a positive\nimpact in their professions as well as relationships.

I wanted to explore their natural potentials to the fullest so that they have a career that they would love. That’s when I discovered this wonderful assessment tool based on biometrics called Dermatoglyphics Multiple Intelligence Test (DMIT). This tool gave me detailed insight into the multiple abilities, nature and learning styles of my children.  I felt the need to make other parents aware of this tool and to help them with benefits of its near accurate results.

My belief in the benefits of the report and passion for\nDMIT made the transition of me as a homemaker to counsellor easier. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Professional challenges\nwere quite a few. There were others in the field who used pirated software to\ngenerate reports but the accuracy and details of their reports were highly\ncompromised. I had to fight against the bad name generated by them for this\nprofession.

The most important\nsubject we teach them is self-worth. I have lost count as to exactly how many\nwomen I have empowered from different walks of life.

Another hurdle was getting\na report from my rural units on a daily basis, as I cannot travel everyday. I\nsolved this problem by buying smart phones for my staff members , video calling\nthem and taking pictures. Teaching was another challenge; I would personally\nmake notes, train my teachers once a month and take a feedback at the end of\nthe month. In Kolkata, getting the street children into mainstream schools was\na problem; also the children would not want to attend school, so we had to get\ncreative and incentivize their coming &nbsp;to\nschool . <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>What\nis the road ahead in 2020?<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>2020\nis relief work; to have a compassionate heart towards the ones who can’t\nsupport themselves in the present situation of CoVid-19.&nbsp; We are working towards helping those in need\nbut we are taking all the precautions \/protection while doing so.

She realized that there was a need gap for a space for\ncurated, diverse books. And Champaca was formed - an independent, women-run\nbookstore, children's library and café which combine\na love for reading, food, events and a strong community too. So, if you are based in\nBangalore and have a strong bonding with books, head for this café. &nbsp;Interestingly, she\nwas first winner of the <a href=\"https:\/\/massentrepreneurship.org\/futurepreneurs-grand-challenge\/\">Futurepreneurs\nGrand Challenge<\/a> organised by Global\nAlliance for Mass Entrepreneurship (GAME), in collaboration with Facebook. <br>\nCatch her as discusses with\nShree Lahiri,&nbsp; about her journey, the\nchallenges, competition, the point of differentiation and more….<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>How did you think about becoming an entrepreneur?<br>  <\/strong>For the last decade, I worked mostly with wildlife and conservation NGOs. It was deeply satisfying work and I got to travel and meet the most amazing people and landscapes. I have always been a reader, and I started doing some library work with children and attended this excellent course called the Library Educator's Course by Bookworm Trust, Goa. I realized that I really wanted a space for curated, diverse books with personal recommendations, and a lively community around books to exist in Bangalore - so I decided to start it. I enjoy the work, even when it is challenging, and I am most pleased that I can determine the culture of my organisation, hire more women and create a safe and friendly space to work in for our employees and to enjoy for our customers.<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>What are some strengths that a woman entrepreneur should possess?<br>  <\/strong>Women are underrepresented in certain industries and outrightly discouraged in others.

We try to resolve this by having stronger processes and creating an environment where people want to stay.

Bangalore has wonderful bookstores, and I respect them deeply for creating and sustaining a culture of reading in the city. I also believe that there is space for more. Our children's library, which we hope to build into a community library in the near future, is now a tiny space for everybody, and through its work we run weekly classes in a small school in Pottery Town. We host events every week that are free and open to the public, both online and offline. We ensure that we bring engaging and meaningful discussions for free - we do not make any money from the library and we are not trying to compete with anyone. <br>Cafe is a very competitive business, with very little room for error.

We choose the books we shelve with care. We believe that a good bookshelf should hold a world of voices and stories, from across time, place and experience. We also enjoy the whimsy of a bookshelf, and hope that our customers discover something fresh and interesting each time they visit—a new way of looking at the world.&nbsp; So we are much more than a cafe, bookstore or event space, we try to create a holistic and calming experience for our customers.<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>What are your future plans?<br> <\/strong>This is a challenging time for all small businesses.

      "post_content": "Q1. <strong>You mentioned this is the first time that a male family member has bequeathed his shares to daughters. This looks very bold and revolutionary on Mr. MV Murugappan’s part considering the tradition of the group. What kind of problems you are facing now after his passing?<\/strong>\n\nI would like to emphasize that my father’s action was not only bold and revolutionary, but also the right one and in keeping with changing times.&nbsp; In this day and age, there is no legitimate reason why daughters should be treated differently from sons when it comes to matters of inheritance. Even the 2005 amendment to the Hindu Succession Act allows for equality between sons and daughters in matters of inheritance.\n\nLet me take a step back and explain to you the background. During his lifetime, my father acted like a true patriarch. He helped the family through challenging times and was there for numerous family members in their time of need-stepping in as a father figure\/mentor to help those who had lost their own, working tirelessly to reconcile troubled marriages, backing those who ran into legal and regulatory issues, and even breaking with family tradition to bring back a family member that had been cast away from the business. He took care of male and female members of the family alike. The overriding message in all that he did was “fairness above all”, “family above business interests”, and “each and every person deserved his love and support”. Every action that he took was meant to preserve the family for the long term and ensure the happiness of its members. Not once did he use his position for personal gain. But unfortunately, what has transpired after his passing is that so many of those whom he personally helped, did not reciprocate in service to his next of kin.\n\nThe family is neither willing to honor my father’s wishes and give us an exit from the business, nor give us board representation like all the other family branches. This is very unfair. This has hurt my mother the most.\n\nQ2.&nbsp;<strong>Did he also tell you how to navigate through this and liquidate your shares if you needed? Or if you should assume position in the group and manage the business? How are you being denied your rights?<\/strong>\n\nMy father’s wish was that we first offer the shares to the family at fair price. That is exactly what we did, but they told us that they did not have the money, and to keep the shares and collect dividend. There are many innovative ways that they could settle the matter, but the actions to date show that they do not have the intent. Given all that my father did for the family, I don’t think he ever imagined that the family would not honor his wishes, and that it would come to a stalemate such as the one we are in right now. I also want to point out that my father named two senior members of the family as executors of his will, and while they were aware of this from September 2017, they made no attempts to initiate the process.\n\nWhen every other family branch has representation on the holding company board, and my father too had representation, I see no reason why after my father we should be denied a position on the board. We are being denied our rights on the basis of our gender.\n\nOver the last two years, we were denied the information on the working of Ambadi Investments Ltd. (AIL). For instance, during the AGM, my queries which were sent to them in advance of the meeting, went unanswered at the meeting. We were not given the minutes of the meeting or video recording when requested.\n\nLate last year, I learned that there was an AIL board meeting, wherein my request for a board position was considered but not acted on, neither was my request for a board position approved, not was a date set for a shareholder meeting to approve the same. I have even written to the independent directors about this matter, and urged them to intervene and ensure that the rest of the board act in the utmost good faith and take necessary steps to remedy the situation at hand, but so far I have not received a response from them.\n\nQ3.&nbsp;<strong>Can you explain how the board is structured and what’s your argument around your representation there?<\/strong>\n\nThe board is comprised of 8 male directors-6 family members and 2 independent directors. While one may argue that giving a board position to our family representative is not legally binding on Murugappa group,\n<ul>\n \t<li>Why is there a representative from every other branch of the family?<\/li>\n \t<li>While we understand it is not legally binding, don’t we have the right to be a part of the board since we are among the largest shareholders? Why should we not be given a board seat (when my father held a board seat with the same shareholding)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nBased on the gender prejudices evident through the family’s history and current stand of MV Subbiah in his various speeches, it is clear that they don’t want a woman to be on the board.\n\nQ4.&nbsp;<strong>What according to you would be a fair settlement?<\/strong>\n\nAll that my mother, sister and I are trying to do is to give effect to my father’s will, exactly as he wished. It was his wish that we settle the matter within the family, and that is what we have been tirelessly working towards for the past over 2 years. We are extremely saddened that after all that my father has done both professionally and personally for the family business and the family, the family continues to drag their feet on the matter. Shouldn’t family come first, above all else?\n\nFor our family to say that they don’t have enough cash, we would like to state there are many innovative ways to do the settlement. All we need is the intent and everything will get sorted with focused discussions on the subject. If they are unwilling to purchase our shares, it is only fair that they induct a representative from our family to the board.\n\nQ5.&nbsp;<strong>What did your father do to groom\/mentor the girl child?<\/strong>\n\nHe stressed on the education of girl child, and the importance of choosing careers that we were passionate about. &nbsp;My sister and I are well educated and settled in our own professions. We, by no means are less educated or experienced than our male counterparts. He completely empowered us through our education, and skillfully guided us through our career paths so that we could&nbsp; take on any role in business. I am a qualified professional, with a doctorate in Nuclear Engineering from the USA and 23 years’ work experience in large multi-national Fortune 500 companies. My sister is an electronics engineer with a decade of work experience in IT Companies.",

At the same time, she also had many guests, a lot of them foreign ones, to entertain. This helped her refine her cooking skills and she made sure that at least I learnt some of them. Later, I was also married to an officer in Air India who has had numerous postings abroad which have also presented us opportunities to entertain guests in different parts of the world, and I am proud that people have always enjoyed the food we have served, to the extent that they have volunteered to learn, or ask me to make them a dish or two. Hence the inspiration to take this forward has always been there; it was only a question of an opportunity or need presenting itself.<\/p>\n<p>Q3. <strong>How easy or tough has it been for you, as a woman entrepreneur, to set up and promote your business?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Luckily for me, setting up this home food venture has not been very difficult. These days, with the advent of social media, it has become very easy for small businesses to get noticed. I began by putting up a few dishes for order on our society Whatsapp groups, then progressed to creating my own Whatsapp group, and then subsequently my daughter created a FB and Instagram page which helps get more visibility. Today, we have become more structured in terms of the food types, the packaging, the promotion, and standardization without compromising on the quality. At the end of the day, we are still the ones actually cooking, and I guess that is the unique selling point. Through word of mouth, we have had the opportunity to serve customers beyond our society for party orders every once in a while. Fortunately, now, we have got a platform to help us reach out to the audience beyond our own society with logistical support as well, with the recently launched homefood app called&nbsp;<strong>Homefoodi&nbsp;<\/strong><em>(available for download now on Android and iOS)<\/em>, in NOIDA.<\/p>\n<p>Q4. <strong>Do you think women entrepreneurs support other women across the value chain of business? How have you impacted\/ supported\/ mentored the careers of other women?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think women entrepreneurs do a fantastic job of creating revenue, and mostly pursuing some things which they enjoy. In our locality, it is a wonderful stimulation seeing such a dynamic role that so many women play as entrepreneurs. We have, right from bakers, to food ventures, to outdoors, event managers, teachers and home tutors, hobby training teachers, to those who sell clothes, home made cosmetics, soaps, and so on. It is wonderful to support and appreciate each other, thereby helping each other grow. I can very proudly state that I helped a lady, one of my immediate neighbours, to begin her own food venture, which is essentially non-veg food (specializing in Awadhi cuisine) and today she is doing very well here.<\/p>\n<p>Q5. <strong>How has the support of friends and family played a role in your being a successful entrepreneur? How do you balance your professional and personal life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I have enjoyed tremendous support from everyone, especially my family. To begin your entrepreneurial venture finally at the age of 55 was something that I never expected, but I seized the opportunity when I got it, and since then, it has been no turning back. Luckily, my home is my office at the moment, and so I am able to manage looking after both together; hosting guests while packing an order for someone, keeping an eye on the chores at home while preparing for snacks for the evening :)<\/p>\n<p>Q6. <strong>Were you trained for this line? Would you like any training now? If so, what kind of training?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The only training that I have had for this has been from my mother. After that, it has been years of practice and refinement, and also continuously adding to our repertoire by trying out new dishes and introducing them to everyone. With my daughter now playing an active role in Mummy's Kitchen, there has been a certain amount of professionalism in terms of the branding, packaging, and a widening of the types of things we make. Our tag team works very well for us together.<\/p>\n<p>Q7. <strong>What is the road ahead in 2020?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The road ahead is now very promising. While I have already established a base in our society, now we have the opportunity to reach out to a large audience with our app now being live. We have also, by virtue of this platform, served food at a couple of events, and we definitely look forward to many more such opportunities. All of these combined can help us not only look at structuring our set-up a little more, but also refining even more; perhaps experimenting more as well! But we are very clear about maintaining the same quality and taste. After all, there is nothing like home food!<\/p>",

      "post_content": "<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“The spirit of entrepreneurship is unique. You will discover it by yourself and then it just takes over you and claims you completely.”<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<!-- \/wp:quote -->\n\n<p><em>You could say that words kept her been spell-bound. And zeroing in on Justwords seems perfect for Payel Mukherjee, Chief Executive, when she set up the content-focused marketing agency to dwell on content experiences. <\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>What exactly makes content engaging? Fostering engagement goes beyond the mingling of words and yes, the “engagement factor” depends on the entire content experience. So, what does it take to create an engaging content experience? Get the right picture as Shree Lahiri talks to Payel about her journey. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;Q1. <strong>Tell us a little about your venture – Justwords. How did you start up, and was your motivation then and, what do you aim to achieve?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Justwords is a content-focussed marketing agency. Our aim is to create growth-focused content experiences and build transformative digital journeys for businesses. Throughout this journey, we help brands tell the right stories, find connected audience, traffic and achieve online growth.<\/p>\n<p>I started Justwords in 2010 with the idea of creating a brand that could be trusted for developing really good copy. I was working then for a specialist media company where we were trying to source good content for some projects. I realised then that good content was hard to find, as were agencies who could provide good content at required deadlines and affordable prices. Online content was going to become the next big thing and I felt this was the right time to start up – something which I had always longed to do. Also, I had a 3-year-old at home, so this was the perfect way I could also spend more time with her as well as pursue my dream of starting my own business.<\/p>\n<p>From a one-woman army, Justwords has emerged as a full-fledged content marketing agency, which even picked up prestigious awards from Google for two consecutive years. We have been growing at an incredible rate the last 4 years and I feel so grateful for that. In the next few years, I want to make brand Justwords synonymous with content experiences in India and the world over. It’s ambitious but I feel we can do through true-blue content marketing. We are also planning to building content marketing courses, especially for small businesses run by for women entrepreneurs, so that they can market their products better.<\/p>\n<p>Q2.<strong> Where did the inspiration for starting out on your own, come from?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Though I worked for first 9 years of my career, I knew I would do something on my own. I get bored easily so I wanted to do something that would excite me and allow me to explore new things everyday.<\/p>\n<p>The spirit of entrepreneurship is unique. You will discover it by yourself and then it just takes over you and claims you completely. You suddenly know when it’s the right time, you find the inspiration and the courage to follow your dream and then you just take a leap of faith.<\/p>\n<p>Q3.<strong> How has your experience been so far, with setting up an entrepreneurship business in Gurgaon?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It’s been an amazing journey so far. Justwords started as a one-woman army and now has become a full-service agency. In a way, Gurgaon provided the perfect setting. There were lots of brands looking for good content and wanting to understand how to explore the online content formats better. We got our first big order from Nokia because we were there at the right time at the right place. A friend of mine had given my reference and I had to go and meet them in order to close the deal. That would not have happened if I was not in Gurgaon. That got us started and provided the revenue to move further. Over the years, this city has given Justwords a lot of opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Q4.<strong> How did your life change as you turned into a woman entrepreneur? What were the challenges you faced, while trying to scale up your business?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>Building a business is almost like raising a baby, infact, sometimes even more demanding than a kid. If you are a woman running a business and you have kids at home, you are constantly running out of time since you looking out for all babies. It’s almost funny how 24 hours is always too short for getting things done.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest challenge while scaling up was finding the right resources. When you are a startup, it’s very difficult to find the right people. They are either not that talented, or don’t share your passion for the work, or are far too expensive. So, the time-frame becomes longer and you end up loading yourself with a lot more work than you can handle.<\/p>\n<p>Q5.<strong> Do you think being a woman entrepreneur worked to your advantage or ushered in challenges?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would just say that being an entrepreneur is a liberating experience. It helped me discover the real me, it gave me the confidence to do what I love to do, to do it my way, to make money on my own terms and live the way I want to. Entrepreneurship has its own set of challenges but, I feel, everything is worth this experience.<\/p>\n<p>Q6.<strong> What was the role your family and friends played in your becoming a successful entrepreneur? How do you balance your professional and personal life?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>Building a business takes a lot of hard work, patience and time. That is impossible to achieve without your family supporting you all the way, especially for women entrepreneurs. I am blessed to have family and friends, who have always rallied to my support whenever I have needed them. My partner has stood rock-solid throughout this journey, helping me overcome the darkest phases of business and find the strength to recover and bounce back. My family, especially my mom and mom-in-law, and close friends have always been there to cheer me up, look after my kids, and make me feel proud of what I have achieved.<\/p>\n<p>It’s difficult to balance between home and work but I am getting better at it. I try to get to office early and come back early, but that does not always work. Also, I try not to take calls post 8pm. My elder daughter used to complain earlier that I am working too much at home, so I am consciously trying to stop that.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Q7.<strong> Do you think women entrepreneurs support other women across the value chain of business? How have you impacted\/ supported\/ mentored the careers of other women?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I was part of Goldman Sachs’10,000 Women Programme – a global initiative to provide women entrepreneurs around the world management education, mentoring and networking. Though I didn’t complete the full term, I did see a lot of women entrepreneurs helping each other post that journey. I think women instinctively reach out to help each other but we need more such communities for women entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<p>I cannot say I have impacted lives yet but I always try to help startup founders (especially women) with whatever knowledge I have. But yes that’s definitely a huge goal for me – helping women entreprenuers, especially those in smaller towns and cities,better market their business and also create an international community of women entreprenuers where everbody helps each other and supports each other.<\/p>\n<p>Q8.<strong> What would be your top 3 secret mantras, for any woman looking to start her own business?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>I would say –<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be patient and build resilience.<\/strong> Building a business is full of ups and downs. There are good times and bad times and you need to accept both to move ahead. You need to believe that you will survive this phase. Try and meditate everyday for at least 15 minutes. This provides a whole lot of mental strength.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make sure what you are delivering – whether product or service is good.<\/strong> If your service\/product is good, people will always come back. There should be no compromise on quality. Make sure you are involved yourself in improving service. Do leave it to your sales team only for the first 2 or 3 years.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Be your own kind of entrepreneur. <\/strong>Business is always measured with success. Don’t let that pressure you. Always do business in the way you feel most comfortable. Don’t let others’ notions of entrepreneurship dictate how you should do business. Work slow and steady and be your own kind of entrepreneur.<\/li>\n<\/ul>",

She opens up to Shree Lahiri about the early years, when it meant travelling by tempos but the inspiring fact was that she got full support from her family. <\/em>\n\n1. <strong>Tell us about how you started out as a woman entrepreneur.<\/strong>\nMy group of women work under ABCDEO which is very famous in Delhi. But we had no space in Delhi and the women faced a lot of problems when we had come to Delhi for a fair through the Ministry of Textiles. We had no place to stay and to keep our goods, so at that time we discussed and formed the team of women, who initially started working.\n\nOur seller groups are at Dastakaar at Chhattarpur  and we go for events there, and we get calls from others too to sell our goods. We do sell at Dilli Haat, but we are not there continuously.  Our goods are handicrafts, which are organic and eco-friendly. There are cotton sarees, chunnis, stonework cooking bowls, trays, mugs and decorative items like flower vase, kettles and so on.\n\nWe try to go to as many events and once I remember we had got an invitation for a global event and we got the chance to spot our PM Narendra Modi, form a distance, which was wonderful!\n\n2. <strong>How did you manage the funds?<\/strong>\nWe took loans in the beginning, which helped us,  but it took very long for the loans to be finalized. Now we have applied for another loan from Rashtriya Mahila Kosh, but we have yet to receive it.\n\n3. <strong>How large is you team and how do you motivate them?<\/strong>\nThere are about 100 ladies, out of which 500 work in really interior areas. The team gets “<span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">josh<\/span>” when they realise the more they work, the more money they will make. I tell my team of ladies, if the production increases, their income too, will increase. But all the women are very committed. They do the handicraft production work and at the same time they are doing the house work and working for their families too, to keep them happy.\n\n4. <strong>Do you feel there is a need for women to be financially independent?<\/strong>\nYes, ladies need to be independent because wherever they are placed, they do need a regular cash flow. So they make the goods, and we sell. Everyone needs to work, even if they are not educated because it is critical that retain they some independence.\n\n5. <strong>Did you get any training to start the production?<\/strong>\nWe got some training, from an NGO. A master came to teach us, but payment had to be made. No one does it free na? We don’t have a website and we are not selling online. But we will be very interested if we can get trained in this area. This will mean that our production will go up, and we can expect more earnings.\n\n6. <strong>What were the problems you faced?<\/strong>\nThere were a lot of challenges and the struggles along the journey was really immense. Even to turn up for work was so difficult. Now we sell sometimes at Dilli Haat and even in Bangalore, Mumbai and Chennai. In Dilli Haat and Nature Bazaar, we managed to get a slot 6\/7 times, and then we could sell there. Now we have been invited to participate in an event from Cottage Industries. We filled up the forms, but we are still waiting for the reply.\n\nNow we have all documents like PAN cards etc all in place – we hope things will improve!\n\n7. <strong>Where do you see your business going, in 5 years’ time?<\/strong>\nWe want to take part in the International Expo at Noida, because if we do, we will get more orders. We also want to get our own showroom and we also want to get into exports in a big way. Now we do get some orders from abroad. But I am interested, because I hear there is a huge demand for our products abroad.",

      "post_content": "<strong>“Becoming independent is really a great feeling!”<\/strong>\n\n<em>Indian women in remote areas find it very difficult to take the decision to step out of their homes, to take up the responsibility of doing something independently, on their own – at their own terms. Rekha Devi, based in Bagru, near Jaipur, in Rajasthan explains to Shree Lahiri how she made this effort, pushing herself beyond her limits. Today she feels it was indeed a wise decision, and both she and her team are happy.<\/em>\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>What was the starting point for you, when you decided to do something on your own?\n<\/strong>In the beginning, ladies used to just sit around and discuss that they wanted to do business. They wanted to make money, have a regular income.\nWe formed a group of nine ladies, and joined Apani Sahakari Sewa Samiti, which is a self-help group in Rajasthan, took a loan of Rs 10,000 each and then got into producing decorative, carved items like elephants, peacock, horse, even Ganeshji; there were other items like sindur dani, pen holders. Then we got another loan and purchased a machine, so that we could work at home. The machine is a great help and our ladies now work efficiently.\nWe also go out of Rajasthan, to Delhi, Goa for melas organsied by the Government. We sell our items here. In Delhi, we are setting up a shop in Dilli Haat, and we plan our products.\nLet me tell you, I also felt that I can move out of my home and get involved in making something which can bring in income. Now we are happy to work together and share the income.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n \t<li><strong>While starting the business activity, how did you get the funds? <\/strong>\nLike I said, we first took a loan to start the business, and then took another loan to buy the machine for making the decorative and carved items.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n \t<li><strong>Do you feel becoming independent has helped you?<\/strong>\nYes, I feel every lady should go through what I did. We all can do this, and becoming independent is really a great feeling. In this way, we can also do something for our families – our children specially. This way, we feel we are doing good work and also contributing to the welfare of the family. So, becoming independent is something that every woman must try to work towards.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n \t<li><strong>Did you get trained to take up this work?<\/strong>\nNo, I started on my own. At that time, my husband used to have a small job, but soon left that job to join me. Now he helps me with the sales. As we travel to sell our products, he also accompanies us.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n \t<li><strong>If you are offered training, will you accept it?<\/strong>\nYes, I will be interested. We do not sell our products online, but if we are given some training, to make our products available online, it would really help us get online orders. That would help us in taking our business activity ahead.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n \t<li><strong>What were the problems you faced in your journey?<\/strong>\nThere were a lot of problems. In the beginning, the ladies did not want to leave their homes and join me. They said they have more work at home. So it took a lot of coaxing, to make them decide. I actually went against all negative signs and went ahead and started with the production of our decorative items. Now the ladies are also happy that they finally decided and moved out of their homes to do something independently. They are also earning an income and they are all happy.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n \t<li><strong>Where do you plan to take your work activity in 3 to 5 years from now?<\/strong>\nI want to be involved in the same work that we are doing now – that much I am sure. But I also want to move ahead and set up our own showroom in Jaipur, as so many tourists visit the city, who can buy our items and thus help us expand our business. Currently we sell our items in Amer, which is a tourists spot, and tourists do buy our products.<\/li>\n<\/ol>",

      "post_content": "<strong>“<\/strong><strong>I am in the world of fashion and fashion keeps changing.<\/strong><strong>” <\/strong>\n\n<em>‘Fashion’ was in her mind right from the beginning. Ms Geeta Jain, from Indore explained how her family business involved fabrics, jeans as they were wholesalers. So, it was quite natural that she was lead into this world. She talks openly to Shree Lahiri on how the germ of this idea came to her, how her team of women are working together, the courses she conducts and more….<\/em>\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>How was it in the beginning when you got into this business?\n<\/strong>In the beginning, I had joined up with my cousin sister and we started working for the NGO – Mahila Bal Vikas Mantralaya. Here we used to do ‘sewa’ for women and children like helping them out, giving gifts during festivals and so on. Then, later on - I thought why not start something of my own?  And, it was quite logical that I chose the world of fashion, since my family has been into various businesses in this area. So I started working in my Boutique called ‘Origin’ in Indore, where I live.  Actually I had this boutique before and used to make ladies’ garments. Today I stitch ladies’ tops, kurtas, skirts, party gowns, saree blouses etc.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n \t<li><strong>Where did you get the funds?<\/strong>\nInitially I worked with my cousin, as she asked me to join. But then I suddenly developed cervical problems and my health was affected. So I focused on the boutique. My sister’s funds helped me to get the rented place , which is just two kms from where I live. Then customers increased too. I also conduct courses for ladies who want to take up this job – so they are taught designing, cutting, stitching – all the functions of a boutique. It is still going on.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n \t<li><strong>How large is your team and how do you encourage them?<\/strong>\nThere are six ladies in my team. The work is divided among them and we work as a team. We are like a family and we help each other. On festivals, we try to have our own celebrations like in Diwali, Holi etc. In Indore, there is the Malwa Utsav in March, where we participated and the sales are quite good.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n \t<li><strong>What are the changes you see today, in the business that you are in?\n<\/strong>I am in the world of fashion and fashion keeps changing. It’s been 10 years since I started. First it was salwars, churidars, suits that were in fashion and today, it is leggings, kurtis, gowns, tops that are in demand. Today ladies take extra care with their clothes and they spend more and make special clothes for festivals like Navratri, Diwali etc. Ladies have become more fashionable. They have their own choice. They even see patterns online and then they ask us to copy them.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n \t<li><strong>Are you aware of government schemes?<\/strong>\nNo I have not availed of any government scheme. There’s a lot of running around involved like to banks etc. I feel I am getting along fine with family support.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n \t<li><strong>Have you been trained for this business? Would you like to get some more training?<\/strong>\nI have been trained. I did Fashion Designing course form NIFT in Indore. If I do get more training and I will get more scope to increase my business, then I will be interested.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n \t<li><strong>What were the problems you faced in your journey?<\/strong>\nIn the beginning I faced problems in the family. My husband was busy with his job and my daughter was 8 years old. My shop is in a residential area, near the airport and I stay in Kalani Nagar, which is 2 kms away.  But since I got into my family business, I managed.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n \t<li><strong>Where do you see your business going in the next 3 years?<\/strong>\nI really want to increase my business. And, I want to continue with my training classes. I tried to start a college for fashion design, but I could run it only for a few months as there were many problems. The costs involved were high, and the students were also less, so I had to discontinue. Then I wanted to take a larger space, and even got offers, but they were far away. So, I decided to remain here. But I want my showroom to be bigger and widen the scope of classes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>",

      "post_content": "<p><strong>“If a lady is not afraid, and has the courage to move ahead and aim for something higher, then nothing is impossible!”<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>At one point of time, she never dreamed that she would be working on her own and managing her work independently. Ms Rekha Parihar from Pilibhit, in UP today took that vital step when she decided to pull herself up and move out of the confines of her home, and even encourage other women – to join her in her business. She shares with Shree Lahiri the initial problems, how her husband’s support helped from the beginning, her immediate future plans and more…<\/em><em style=\"font-size: inherit;\">&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>How did you think about becoming an entrepreneur?<br><\/strong>I was a housewife and I used to be happy living an easy life - staying at home and spending my free time sleeping. Then it was my husband who pointed out something that actually changed my life. He suggested that instead of sleeping, why don’t I seriously think about something that I could do to keep myself occupied. To be frank, I was scared at the beginning, but he encouraged me all the way. <br>I started my business by going around and encouraging ladies to step out of their houses and get involved in some activity that can take care of their wants in life. So, I started the Samaj Seva Shiksha Committee where I went about urging women to start something of their own – like cultivation of mushrooms, creating handicrafts from water hyacinth and products like mosquito repellants from cow dung too. We collect these and sell them at markets like Dilli Haat. The ladies work independently, and we buy the products from them and sell these at haats. We also sell dry mushrooms, wet mushrooms that are cultivated by the women. We have also taken these products to Bangalore, Hyderabad, Jabalpur, Chandigarh, Chitrakoot and Gujarat too.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>What are some strengths that a woman entrepreneur should possess?<br><\/strong>The daily needs of a woman cannot be always satisfied by a husband’s salary, so to fulfill her needs she needs to start something on her own, which can bring in some income. It is important she should not hesitate to be independent, and must take the risk. She must be hard-working, because that it key to success. She should not be under the <em>pardah<\/em>, and should be ready to go out of her house and start something of her own.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you?<br><\/strong>I started out in 2014 and at that time, it was extremely difficult to motivate women to come out of their houses. They were hesitant and some even said that their husbands would not allow. Now that they have taken the step, they have formed groups to work, according to the location they stay and are independent and growing!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>How did you get funds?<br><\/strong>First we used our own funds and invested in providing women training and financial support to start on their own. It’s like taking care of a child, first feed them, help them in every way and then they learn to stand on their own feet!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Do you think the current business scenario encourages women entrepreneurship?<br><\/strong>Yes definitely. If a lady is not afraid, and has the courage to move ahead and aim for something higher, then nothing is impossible! Today everything is possible. She can overcome her fear and also get support. This is applicable to men too, if they want to start something, they will need support.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>How do you handle the fierce competition?<br><\/strong>As of now, there is no competition. It competition does come up in the future, I don’t think we will face any problem, because we have enough experience. We also have support from the village MP, who is in favour of women empowerment!<strong style=\"font-size: inherit;\">&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>What are your future plans?<br><\/strong>As of now, we are working in one district – Pilibhit, near Bareilli in UP. We plan to go to other districts too. We hope to go to Uttarakhand and Sultanpur so that we can encourage more women to enter the business world and become independent.\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Any tips for someone starting out today? <br><\/strong>They should have confidence to Once she starts, she should continue. Even if she faces&nbsp; failure, she should not get discouraged or break down, for failure is a part of success!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

      "post_content": "<strong>“We strive to provide health benefits to people all over India by our result-oriented herbal products. We also strive to expand and get into exports.”<\/strong>\n\n<em>Sudha Agarwal, started her business way back in early 2000 when she saw positive healing effect of ayurvedic medicines in Chattisgarh. She noticed that allopathy did not provide permanent remedy to people with health problems, they suffer from serious side effects. She shares with Shree Lahiri how she started her own business - Ayurved Health House in 1995 and how she worked hard to keep the business going. Today it is manufacturing more than 100 proprietary and classical Ayurvedic products<\/em>.\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>How did you get the idea of starting this business?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\nI used to see sick people around me and most of them had taken recourse to allopathic medicine, which often left serious side effects. I also remembered my grandmother’s natural medicines that she recommended for any kind of illness. These were more effective and had no side effects. So, I thought why not serve people by giving them good medicines when they fell sick.\nOur mission is - “To be recognized around the globe as the essence of true Ayurveda – in its purest form” which is clearly put in our website: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paawanherbal.com\/\">www.paawanherbal.com<\/a>.\n<ol start=\"2\">\n \t<li><strong>What was the support from your family?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\nI got full support from my family – from my husband and everyone else. My children being small supported me at their best. My husband helped me a lot and advised me to take on this business. It is because of his able guidance and complete support, both in production and marketing, I had been able to achieve success in business.\n<ol start=\"3\">\n \t<li><strong>Where did you get the funds?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\nI started my business with small savings that I had done and had further I had taken bank loan to supplement my further requirement for plant &amp; machinery and working capital.\n<ol start=\"4\">\n \t<li><strong>Did you get any training?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\nInitially Ayurveda was a new subject for me. So I read a lot of ayurvedic texts, had discussions with ayurvedic doctors and vaidyas for development of herbal formulation. We had formed a team and with various trials we were finally able to develop formulations with good results. Today, my daughter is also an ayurvedic doctor, and got gold medal in her finals. I discuss with her for new innovations in Ayurveda.\n<ol start=\"5\">\n \t<li><strong>Are you aware of any government schemes that support women entrepreneurs?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\nI haven’t taken support of any government schemes. I came to know that government is supporting women entrepreneurs and there are various schemes for them. But most of the schemes are for starting a new business. I would like to know if there is any scheme for expansion and renovation of existing units. I definitely look forward to expand business with government support.\n<ol start=\"6\">\n \t<li><strong>Did you face any problems in your journey?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\nDefinitely, we face various problems in running a business. And being a women entrepreneur marketing is a tuff job for me. Besides in our state there is not much support for local units in government purchase. Moreover, Chhattisgarh being a small state we have to be dependent on other states for procuring packing material, for getting lab test of our products and various other things.\n<ol start=\"7\">\n \t<li><strong>Any achievements of that you would like to share with us?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\nOur unit got National Award for Best Small Scale Women Entrepreneur from Ministry of SISI Central Government in the year 2002. It was given by Hon’ble Ex Finance Minsiter Jaswant Singh and Hon’ble Ex Industry Minister Vasundhara Raje Sindhia under Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\n\nWe received another award in 2014 – State Award for Best Woman Entrepreneur by Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh Hon’ble Dr Raman Singh.\n<ol start=\"8\">\n \t<li><strong>Would you like to meet other women entrepreneurs like you, if you get the opportunity?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\nYes, I would really like to meet them.\n<ol start=\"9\">\n \t<li><strong>Where do you see your business going in the next two years?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\nIn next two years we would like to expand our presence across India. We also want to expand and get into exports. Already we have customers who carry our products abroad. We also send our products through VPP to most of the parts on India which gives us confidence about its acceptability across nation. If I get some training for improving my online sales, I will definitely take it up as only then we will be able to progress.\n<ol start=\"10\">\n \t<li><strong>How large is your team and how do you motivate your team to do better?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\nWe have around 15 – 20 people for marketing and production consists of around 10 – 12 people. So, a total of around 30 members are there in our team. We inspire them by giving regular perks on the basis of their performance. We also provide residential facility to our employees who are in need for them. Our aim is to build conducive environment for them so that they can give their best.\n<ol start=\"11\">\n \t<li><strong>Tell us something more about your business ?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\nOur products are GMP (Goods manufacturing Practice) certified are available in various Khadi Stores in Delhi, Mumbai, Nagpur and so on.\n\nOur range of products includes – syrups, tablets, capsules, ointment, soap – shampoo, herbal juices and classical medicines like guggul-vati, asav-aristh etc\n\nWe manufacture medicines for all age group of any gender.

We were promoting small\nproduction efforts at the village level.

What is the\nstarting point for venturing out on a business of your own?<br>\n<\/strong>The situation was like this. I had 25 years experience as a textile\ndesigner and 12 to 15 years I spent as a Textile Head in an institute. My\nhusband is a geologist in the central government and he has a transferable job\nand we moved often. Everytime we shifted, there was so much unpacking and\nresettling that I had to do. Soon I started my own business in home décor,\nwhich were easy to pack as no glue or nails are used and the material used in\nwood. Since I am a lover of animals I based my designs on them – bookshelves,\nanimal heads for wall décor, dining table accessories, office accessories like\npen\/card holders etc. All are animal based – deer, pig, cow, rabbit, dog, snake.\nThere are wooden &nbsp;items for kids too –\ntoy planes, learning items like alphabets etc. Then there are fashion and\njewellery articles too. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. How did you manage\nto get funds in the beginning?<\/strong> <br>\nIt was all my funds and my husband also contributed, as he supported me from\nthe beginning. We did not manage to get funds from the government. When we\ntried to use a government scheme, the minus point was we had to show assets of\nRs 6 lacs to be eligible for a loan….that we did not have!<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q. Did you undergo\ntraining? Are you looking for any specific training now?<\/strong> <br>\nOh, I give training now to others, but if I do get training I can do well. I\nworked in soft material, but now on hard material which is wood. The design is\ndifferent in both, so may be in this area. The training I want now is to learn\nto export my business, so that I can get bulk orders. <br>\nWe have taken part in Exhibitions like “Vibrant Gujarat”, which was a good\nplatform, but there were problems. International delegates did not come to our\nstall, and even our PM Modi with all his security did not come towards our side\nof the exhibition. We were waiting to welcome PM in our stall, and we wanted to\nsee his reaction, but we were disappointed. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q.

What are the\ndifficulties that came your way?<\/strong><br>\nIt’s the normal challenges that ladies face – there is the gender issue. Even\nafter have a wide experience of 25 years, people do not take me seriously. When\nI started, I needed machines for designing and had to get it done outside, but\nthere was a lot of opposition and non-cooperation issues . Once my designs got\ncopied! I tell the girls in my team and encourage them – if this can happen to\nme with my vast experience, what will they face?<br>\nNow I have developed a system and people understand, and even feel I am\ngenuine. But exploitation is there definitely for us women in business. If I\nmanage to get funds, then I can invest in machines (laser, CNC machines) and\neven keep machine operators. All this will help me to grow my business further.\n<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q.

Read on….<\/em>\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>How did you start your business?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIt started ten years ago, when I got the idea to start my own business. And I knew stitching, so I thought why not? Initially I started ladies clothes and then I got a team of 15 ladies together. But it was very difficult. Now I supply clothes to a boutique.\r\n\r\nIn Indore they are many ready-made clothes that silaiwalle take up. And I tried this for sometime. The order was for shirts for gents. But the income was very low, as margins were small. So, I gave it up and started making only clothes for women like lehnga cholis, frocks, tops, kurtas, patialas, palazzos, churidars, salwars and so on. Whatever is in fashion, we try to make. I have five women working and we supply to boutiques and women who place orders.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>How are you funding it?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIn the beginning no one supported me. But my family was a great help. My husband has his own work, but he supported me. Even now, I am supporting myself. Now my daughter helps me in my accounts.\r\nCertainly, we would like to get big orders and make more money.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Do ladies need to be independent?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nYes, ladies need to work and move ahead. We have a lot of talent, but it has to come out and then only can we become independent. There is a big Mahila Sangh here and we came to know that there is a movement to help ladies go forward.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Do you require any training? Do you need any better knowledge of government incentives that will help you to move ahead?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nYes I would like to undergo training. We need to upgrade our knowledge of markets. The government has announced many incentives for women, but we still have to really experience it. They have not reached us.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>What sort of training will help you to improve awareness of your business?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nI would like to improve the quality of my business, so maybe I would like training in making better quality clothes, using better machines. And I would like to know how I can reach better markets. Market information will be useful\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Would you like to meet other women entrepreneurs? <\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nYes I would like to many other women who are in business. Then maybe I will be able to reach out to better markets.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>In the next two years, what is the future you can foresee? <\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nBy then the new government will come in. We hope we get more help and we can make our business bigger.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

      "post_content": "The “Gourmet Jar” was started by Apeksha Jain, from her home kitchen in 2012. An ex-French-teacher and an Eco Graduate from Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi, this food blogger-turned-entrepreneur, is a self-taught confiturier who’s passion for cooking is monitored by her instinct and a husband, who loves food! Listen to her talking about her passion...\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Tell us a little about your venture. How long ago did you start up? What has been your motivation and what do you aim to achieve?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWe produce some of the finest gourmet condiments which are handmade in small batches. Our range of captivating condiments include preserves, pesto, mustard, savoury spreads and infused honey that are 100% natural and contains no preservatives. I started the brand from my home kitchen in 2012 and moved to a plant setup in 2014. I realised that the condiment space is quite stagnant and wanted to shake-up the market place with some distinct flavour combinations. Our aim is to make TGJ condiments an integral part of people’s lifestyle.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Where did the inspiration for setting up a business come from?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMy husband has a major sweet tooth and while on holiday in Burgundy we had a homemade banana jam at a small B&amp;B. For him, it was love at first bite. When we were back in India, he used to keep reminiscing about that banana jam so I did some googling on the basics of making jam, and made my very first batch. It came out amazing! He loved it, and hence I started experimenting with more flavours. Eventually friends and family started loving my preserves. I knew by then that I wanted to work in the food industry. One day it dawned on me that the Indian jam market was synonymous with artificially-flavoured, full-of-sugar and colouring products. I realised that there was nothing like what I was making - interesting flavours made in an artisanal style from fresh ingredients and no preservatives. So I set up a Facebook page in May 2012, and started selling my preserves directly to customers.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. How easy or tough has it been for you, as a woman entrepreneur, to set up and promote your business?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nManaging people was quite tough initially, especially blue collared staff. And getting people to take you seriously is always a challenge for a woman entrepreneur. Also, dealing with governmental bureaucracy was quite intimidating and difficult in the early stages of setting up the business. Things have certainly improved but I believe we still have a long way to go!\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Do you think women entrepreneurs support other women across the value chain of business? How have you impacted\/ supported\/ mentored the careers of other women?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI feel women entrepreneurs are not as supportive of their counterparts as men normally are, but this trend is thankfully changing. The new generation of womenpreneurs realise the many benefits of a strong support system.\r\n\r\nMany women who are just starting out in their ventures get in touch with me for advise, and suggestions, or perhaps even to ask for contacts in the industry. And I'm happy to share my experiences with them so that they can learn from it, and give them my advice. But at the same time, I make sure that I give them the tough reality of the industry so that they don't expect the road ahead to be easy. I think this kind of reality check helps in making the right decisions.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. How has the support of friends and family played a role in your being a successful entrepreneur? How do you balance your professional and personal life?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSupport of friends and family is crucial in being successful as an entrepreneur. Any new business requires so much of your time and dedication, that if you don't have a supportive family, you'll be torn between work and home all the time, which will only lead to less-than-desired performance on both fronts. For me, my husband has been a tremendous support in my journey, whether it was pitching in for household responsibilities, or helping me out after his office hours. And most importantly, he was the one to keep pushing me and to encourage me on days when things seemed to go in the wrong direction. After he quit his job to join me in the business, the line between professional life and personal life has definitely become more blurred, as we're constantly talking about work, but we try to take a short holiday every few months where we make it a point to leave work behind and recharge ourselves. And we also make sure Sundays are no-shop-talk days.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. What is the road ahead in 2018?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWe are trying to innovate in other categories of condiments by fine-tuning new recipes based on feedback from analysts. We are planning to release a bunch of new products along with expanding business into cities such as Chennai, Ahmedabad and Pune.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

Having spent more than 25 years in the IT industry, she has served in many leadership positions in leading IT firms like HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra and Tata Infotech Ltd (TCS) across India, Europe, US, MEA &amp; APAC regions. When she returned from South Africa to India, she got the chance to break out on her own. She chats with Madhura Chakrabarty to reveal her story….<!--more-->\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Tell us a little about your business venture, how long you are into this and what is your motivation behind the idea.<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nStarting something on my own and building an enterprise from scratch was always a dream. I wanted to set up a business where I could utilize my professional skills and at the same time fulfil my creative passion. However, the comfort of having a corporate job and the financial stability of drawing a salary at the end of every month made me defer my plan for several years.\r\n\r\nA Computer Science Engineer by profession, with 25 years+ experience in the IT industry, I  have served in senior positions in leading IT firms like HCL Technologies, Tech Mahindra and Tata Infotech Ltd (TCS) across India, Europe, US, MEA &amp; APAC regions.\r\n\r\nAfter a 3-year stint in South Africa, I relocated to India in 2014, and worked briefly for 1.5 years in Mumbai. Around this time, I took a sabbatical from work to complete an academic course I had enrolled for, while in South Africa. A break from a regular job gave me time to step back and really evaluate my options and my true passion. At the end of the course, I had made up my mind not to go back to a corporate job!\r\n\r\nI worked hard to set up an e-commerce venture that showcases the art and craft from the eastern states of India namely Odisha, Bengal, Bihar and the North Eastern states. Since childhood I always had a special interest and liking for handicraft items. Also, an in-depth knowledge of the art and crafts, history, culture and heritage of this region encouraged me in this direction.\r\n\r\nFor three months I carried out extensive research in this field, understood the market (eg how handicraft clusters are organized district wise), understood the potential as well and challenges in this field and so on. The next 3 months I travelled extensively in the rural belts of these states, visited various regional fairs, visited tribal villages, self-help groups and had face to face interactions with the artisans. Many of them have learnt the craft from their elders in the family. Many of the villages are not well connected and the only mode of communication is the Indian Postal Service. Most of them communicate only in their mother tongue. Knowing the local language is crucial. (Since I am from the same region, communication was not a problem). Due to all these limitations, they do not have many sales channels through which they can showcase their talent. They are solely dependent on the local art retailers who in turn are dependent on the small number of tourists visiting these places. However, one thing common among all these people is the tremendous love for their art and the determination to keep the art alive.\r\n\r\nIt took me some time to set up the supply chain with a few self- help groups and individual artisans in these regions. After putting other elements like creative contents, E-commerce website etc., I launched the site - <a href=\"http:\/\/www.arteastic.in\/\">www.arteastic.in<\/a>, in November 2017. So far, the response has been very positive and encouraging. However, there is a tremendous potential to reach out to a greater audience.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>What made you interested in the handicraft industry of the East?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nI was always a great lover and a consummate user of all kinds of handicraft products since my childhood. During my college days in Kolkata, I would always visit various state emporia to buy clothes, jewellery and bags. At a later stage when I started wearing sarees, handloom sarees always attracted me more than synthetic ones. I loved their vibrant colours and ever-green style. I always wondered about the skill and dedication of the artisans who largely remain unknown to us. I also observed that some of the exquisite and rare art forms from these states are largely unknown to the rest of the country. Many craft forms like Palm-leaf paintings, Silver filigree etc are facing extinction due to lack of promotion.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>What are the challenges that you are facing being a woman entrepreneur?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThere are many challenges to set up an enterprise from scratch. One cannot afford to know only the core business (like handicraft sector and e-commerce in my case). There are multiple aspects of a business starting from legal, finance, supply chain, marketing andso on. I had to have a fair grasp over all these aspects. While working in an organization, one has the support of an entire eco-system. But here, I had to be hands-on in everything.\r\n\r\nHowever, I cannot categorise anything specific as a challenge for being a woman entrepreneur. In fact, setting up my own enterprise gave me greater flexibility and control over my time and decisions. Though I work seven days a week, I can decide when to schedule a field trip and who do I want to work with.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>How do you support other women entrepreneurs across the value chain of business? How have you impacted or inspired the careers of other women?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWhile setting up the business, I had to work with multiple freelancers and small\/medium business owners. I was pleasantly surprised to meet so many other women entrepreneurs. Women are virtually in every field. It gave a great sense of satisfaction to see that women have come out of their comfort zones and are ready to take a path less travelled.\r\n\r\nAlmost 60-70 percent of the professionals I work with are women. There are accountants, content developers, Web developers, photographers and so on. Many of the artisans in the field are women – eg many of the embroidery artists in Shantiniketan, the Madhubani artists in Bihar, Pattachitrapainters from Odisha are women. Some other crafts like Dokra, Weaving etc. are run as family enterprises or self-help groups where women have a significant contribution.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>What would be the top 3 things to watch out for a woman who wants to start up on her own?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nOne should have real conviction. Do not take it up only as a hobby or passion. Take it up as a profession. I have come across women who get into something but lack accountability. If you decide to set up something, please do it with all seriousness and be accountable. Do not look at it as something that only keeps you engaged or fulfils your passion.\r\n\r\nI personally put a lot of importance in remaining connected with the customers. Keeping in touch with my customers, sending them regular updates and seeking feedback for improvement are key to my business.\r\n\r\nNever compromise on the quality and authenticity of your products. Never take short-cuts for success. Always deliver what you have promised, consistently.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>How has the support of friends and family played a role in your being a successful entrepreneur?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nRight from beginning both my daughters were excited and encouraging about my venture. They were always confident that my company would do well. My younger daughter (who is 14) was the first one to inform all her friends to follow my brand on Instagram when it was launched. My husband is more than happy to accompany me in most of my field trips to exotic rural locations in India. Coming from an FMCG background, he was also involved in the creative aspects of the brand. My extended family has also been greatly enthusiastic in providing me with information and tips regarding various products and artisans.\r\n\r\nMy friends in India and abroad have always shown great interest and enthusiasm in my venture. In fact, they were among my first customers and critics as well. They have also been my brand ambassadors in spreading information about and awareness of my brand.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>What are your plans for Arteastic in the future?<\/strong><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nMy venture is for showcasing authentic and high-qualityhandcrafted art forms. Some of these are dying gradually due to lack of knowledge, promotion and patronage. So, one of the main objectives is to preserve the art by promotion in digital media and help artisans by providing them a digital sales channel.\r\n\r\nThrough digital media and social media, I am also trying to reach a greater audience including overseas markets of art lovers. I also want art lovers and curious youngsters to visit my site and get knowledge and interesting facts about various forms of art and craft. I have created a blog for the same and intend to keep relevant and useful information in that. I also plan to collaborate with regional artists and publish interactions with them on a regular basis. The ultimate objective is to explore how technology can be used to help preserve and promote our outstanding heritage.",

      "post_content": "<strong>“Women entrepreneurs are creating synergies with other women to get ahead in the game.”<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Soon after completing Master Degree in Media Science, with a specialization in marketing, Sagarika Dev started her own clothing label ‘Raaika’, the brand which has got the attention of online shoppers. Today, it is growing rapidly to reach an even wider range of audience. <\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>Originally from a small hill station called Haflong in Assam, Sagarika moved to Kolkata 7 years back, and since then she was determined to do something unique that would lead her towards her goal.<\/em>\r\n\r\n<em> In conversation with Shree Lahiri, she reveals where she gets her inspiration from. <\/em><em>“A girl should be two things: who and what she wants” said <\/em><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/author\/show\/3004479.Coco_Chanel\">Coco Chanel<\/a><\/em><em> – this is from where she gets the energy to follow her dream and move forward, despite many obstacles that life had laid before her.<\/em>\r\n\r\n<strong>1) Tell us a little about your venture. How long ago did you start up? What has been your motivation and what do you aim to achieve?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nRaaika is an online clothing brand of women’s western outfit. It represents every fashion-conscious and independent woman who wants to look good, feel great and confident about herself. With our extensive research and fashion forecasting methods, we bring out the designs which are unique, latest and trendiest - yet truly affordable.\r\n\r\nThe venture was incorporated on February, 2017. However, it was April, 2017, when Raaika went live online for the very first time. That’s when the dreams started to come true. It is more than a brand to me, it is a seed which we planted and now we can witness it growing.\r\n\r\nSelf-confidence has always been the motivating factor for me as I have always believed that right outfits always bring the best out of a woman, by making her more confident and self-assured in whichever role she is representing. On that account, the aim is to be the brand which should always be present in the wardrobe of every single fashion-conscious woman.\r\n\r\n<strong>2) Where did the inspiration for setting up a business come from?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWhenever I bump into people I know but not very close, a common question I get asked is –“Wow you’re running a brand now! Did you start it after you completed your fashion designing course?”\r\n\r\nBut, I believe things do not work in that way all the time. Inspiration does not always come from what you study. Even though being from Media &amp; Marketing background, apparel designing and visualising has always been an important part of me. So, the inspiration comes within. It is the inner-self which has inspired and motivated me to chase the dream and make it a reality!\r\n\r\nIt is not always necessary that a specialist of a particular field can be a good entrepreneur and vice-versa. Moreover, in my case, self-inspiration plays a big role to motivate me as I have looked at things from different angles. Being passionate about apparel designing and shopaholic at the same time has helped me to acquire a lot of knowledge about brands, textiles and their designs. My post-shopping excitement never ended with a selfie or donning new outfits. My excitement has always extended to the technical knowledge I acquired by researching and studying every new outfit that I used to purchase. I still do the same!\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, being from Media &amp; Marketing background I have always been a great enthusiast understanding human behaviour &amp; psychology. With the evolution of social media, my interest in understanding and researching human behaviour on social media platforms has grown immensely and hence, the connection with the fashion industry has grown even stronger. It has helped me to a great extent to understand my potential business opportunities way before my venture was incorporated. These have played an integral role, inspiring me to start this venture.\r\n\r\n<strong>3) How easy or tough has it been for you, as a woman entrepreneur, to set up and promote your business?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIt has never been an easy journey. Things cannot be special if they are easy to achieve. It doesn’t matter which gender you represent as an entrepreneur, because the process remains the same.\r\n\r\nThe challenge for every entrepreneur in this clothing industry is the competition. Competing with international labels as they all have online presence and also with the booming domestic online brands - it is never easy to fit your products in as a start-up brand. However, with proper management, a balanced working team and understanding consumer psychology - things can be set. Also, it is important to understand that promoting your business is not all about spending money; it is more of a tactical approach by doing things which are relevant and which increases the awareness of your brand.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, being a woman in this ‘still’ male dominant culture, I feel blessed that I am an employer of 15 people currently, and it feels great to be the reason for someone’s employment where the majority of your employees are men! This shows gender can never become a pivotal factor, if you have the intensity.\r\n\r\nAs I have mentioned previously, entrepreneurship doesn’t represent any gender, it is a regular practice and discipline attached to your mind and soul.\r\n\r\nComing to a big city like Kolkata from a very small town called ‘Haflong’-  in the hills of Assam, I have never felt for once that I am inferior to anyone because I am a woman! That I belong to a small town, who is now in this “City of Joy”. The same confidence and message I would like to convey to every individual woman and the upcoming woman entrepreneurs. Things are never meant to be easy, so in hard situations don’t let yourself down by comparing yourself with your corporate counterparts. If you have the belief and the self-confidence, you can reach any heights regardless of what gender you are!\r\n\r\n<strong>4) Do you think women entrepreneurs support other women across the value chain of business? How have you impacted\/ supported\/ mentored the careers of other women?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nYes, I do think women entrepreneurs are creating synergies with other women to get ahead in the game. They have figured out a ‘pay-it-forward’ mentality through mutual respect and ingeniously want to see each other succeed.\r\n\r\nIt really feels great to be the person and, as a woman who can make an impact on other women’s career or life. In my case, one of my employees, decided to handover her notice period at work. It was really unexpected from her and when I asked the reason, I heard the same old story which we all are used to. Her parents want her to get married as she has younger sisters, who need to get married too. Initially I thought not to intervene as it is their personal matter but, later on when I spoke to her personally I realised that being a woman myself I just couldn’t let another woman be forced not to fulfil her dreams! Marriage is not everything for a woman. So, I decided to speak to her parents personally (without thinking what would be the outcome!). I was well aware it would not be an easy task (as I know how uncompromising Indian parents could be, where marriage is concerned)!\r\n\r\nHowever, the outcome was sweet, though not expected! Her parents postponed her marriage for a year and surprisingly, they are looking for a ,son-in-law who would let their daughter work even after marriage!!\r\n\r\n<strong>5) How has the support of friends and family played a role in your being a successful entrepreneur? How do you balance your professional and personal life?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nParents did play a significant role for what I have achieved so far. Without their support and patience, things wouldn’t have happened the way it has! Being the only daughter, it is always obvious to assume that any typical Indian family would think of marriage; or, they would always prefer their daughters to work in a MNC company, because setting up a business takes time and money (with huge risks involved!).\r\n\r\nBut things were different for me; I got immense support from my parents. Every day, they always show their great interest in helping me move my business forward. It really motivates me a lot and makes me even stronger as a woman!\r\n\r\nYes, sometimes it does get hectic to balance professional and personal life but, I always try to maintain an equilibrium. It is very important to realise we work to live the life we desire to. So, paying attention to your personal life is more of a reward to yourself!!\r\n\r\n<strong>6) What is the road ahead in 2018?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWithin a month, we are going to launch our fourth collection, which I am sure will mesmerise our existing brand audience!!\r\n\r\nAlso, we are digging more and more to understand the market gap, the opportunities and the psychology of the consumer -  which will lead us towards better product development and will also cater to the needs of every woman’s wardrobe.\r\n\r\nLater this year, our fifth collection will also go live.\r\n\r\nA very busy and important year ahead!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

      "post_content": "&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>“Being a woman, the first thing that innately comes to us is empathy and the ability to connect to a person.”<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<em> <\/em><em>Nitu Bajwa Malladi, Nutrition and Fitness Coach describes herself as <\/em><em>mother, a fitness freak, a former mountaineer and amateur chef. She shares her story with Shree Lahiri on how she managed to shed loads of fat and took up fitness as her goal in life. Then she worked in a fitness centre and now has branched out on her own, giving consultation in fitness and wellbeing. Read on, to find out what she has to say…<\/em>\r\n\r\n<strong>1) Tell us a little about your business venture. How long ago did you start up? What has been your motivation\/inspiration and what do you aim to achieve?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI have been in the fitness industry for over 2 years now. Initially I was associated with an online health portals a fitness consultant where I managed a good client base, ranging from doctors, working professionals, business heads, house wives, young professionals, pilots ,CEOs, bankers etc. Recently, I branched out on my own with my brand ‘Nitu Bajwa’. The motivating factor being the ability to help and assist people with their health and fitness goals, making them achieve their dreams of a better health, through my expertise.  What really thrills me is the part where I can help them understand and achieve their health goals, hand-holding them. The connect one makes with an individual during the consultation gives me immense satisfaction and motivates me. I am a firm believer of educating people\/clients about their lifestyle and how easy it is to make sustainable changes in it - to maintain good health and fitness levels. It's my way of giving back to the society I am a part of.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>2) How has your experience been so far, with setting up an entrepreneurship business?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThings have been on a roller coaster pace till now, with tons of work. Setting up  the tech support and website - it's like giving birth to a child, where you have to be mindful of every tiny requirement the infant has, till she grows up to be independent. It's been a good learning experience till now - with so many aspects, right from making sure that client service, finance, legal, tech support  everything is in place. I have taken professional assistance to get all these in place form venture.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>3) How easy\/ tough has it been for you, as a woman entrepreneur, to set up your business? What are your plans to scale up?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI would say it’s been super easy! Being a woman, the first thing that innately comes to us is empathy and the ability to connect to a person; and these two aspects are extremely important in my business. I am working on associating my brand with a few other brands in the fitness sector, and there are plans to expand.  There are many things in the pipeline, like to get in more coaches on my platform.\r\n\r\n<strong> <\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>4) Do you think being a woman entrepreneur worked to your advantage or brought challenges to your path?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nFitness industry till now was a male dominated one, but with time a lot of female experts have created their own niche. Today it’s a very balanced field, where the gender has no importance, what makes a difference is how knowledgeable one is about the latest developments and researches, how well one can guide and help the clients and above all, your personal fitness levels - you got to walk the talk. My biggest advantage being my age, having brought up two kids and gone through the stage of a very unhealthy lifestyle which integrated into a healthy one. I have been through the different stages and that helps me a lot to identify and solve issues with others.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>5) What would be the top 3 things to watch out for, if you're a woman looking to start her own business?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nA man or a woman, the three things that I rate highest to start your own business are - vision, hard work and integrity. Rarely, you would find businesses not working inspite of these three aspects in place!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>6) How has the support of friends and family played a role in your being a successful entrepreneur? How do you balance your professional and personal life?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMy family has been very supportive of my venture, and without their support it would have been very difficult to pull it off! My husband has been in the corporate field for many years and his expertise came in handy, while getting all the legalities and the website work in place. I work 5 days a week and the weekends are strictly for family and ‘me’ time. My kids are in a growing stage and they require my undivided attention. I am also into dramatics, trekking and I love cooking….these things help me unwind and spend quality time with my family and friends.",

      "post_content": "Having co-founded her company - Katha Pictures just three months ago, Anshu Patni Singhi is all excited about her business venture. In an open chat with Shree Lahiri, she touches on how the idea germinated, her media background, the disruption happening around, getting used to being a woman entrepreneur and more...\r\n\r\n<strong>1) Tell us a little about your business venture. How long ago did you start up? What has been your motivation\/inspiration and what do you aim to achieve?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe company is just 3 months old. I have been in media for the last 14 years and the motivation was to use my experience to build a company which partners with brands and companies and create content IP’s along with them rather than being vendors. This is the age of disruption and business models are changing everyday as is the landscape driven by technological and economical changes. This is in essence the genesis of Katha Pictures, to be a content studio, which is known for all forms and formats of storytelling. Simply put, to create content which is part of people’s lives through brands, platforms or any other products.\r\n\r\n<strong>2) How has your experience been so far, with setting up an entrepreneurship business?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWe are still new into the business, but the response has been tremendous as there is a lacuna in the market for a content studio. We have great team of collaborators and storytellers and if your work ethics are strong and people respect you for that, things fall into place sooner or later.\r\n\r\n<strong>3) How easy\/ tough has it been for you, as a woman entrepreneur, to set up your business? What are your plans to scale up?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI don’t think there is any difference in the challenges a woman or a male entrepreneur faces the in current environment. Setting up is always easy but sustaining is tough. The media and entertainment business is in a state of transition where brands are understating how to create better forms of storytelling in the digital age. There is a lot of education and work required and we are working towards that with our partners\r\n\r\n<strong>4) Do you think being a woman entrepreneur worked to your advantage or brought challenges to your path?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nProfessionally, no. Because challenges are always the same. However, as a woman the approach sometimes is different. As women we have our own set of fears and conditioning which we need to learn to let go off. Not that men don’t have it, just that they work on it better as compared to women.\r\n\r\n<strong>5) What would be the top 3 things to watch out for, if you're a woman looking to start her own business?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMany a time, women under estimate and undervalue themselves and seek validation from others. However, they don’t need this or have to wait for others to notice and reward them for their contributions. All we need to do is remind ourselves how we have reached there and believe in our capabilities.\r\n\r\n<strong>6) Women often tend to ask for less money when in negotiations. It is fine to quote an amount you think you deserve and not be worried about the opposite party!<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMake your own networking list: When you start a business, you need all the help in the world and that’s when you need to sit and make a list of people you want to reach out to. It’s okay to reach out to as many people you want to. Don’t hesitate in reaching out and making them part of your ally network.\r\n\r\n<strong>7) How has the support of friends and family played a role in your being a successful entrepreneur? How do you balance your professional and personal life?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMy family and a group of close friends have been my backbone and biggest support system. When I am away, my husband and family support me in taking care of our 3 1\/2 year old daughter. Also, the support system in family and friends make you want to go back to work without worrying much. But also, my business partner Suparn is a man and we respect each other’s family time; so, depending on who needs me more, I divide my time. Sometimes the balance is more towards work and sometimes towards family!",

      "post_content": "<strong>“Women are multi-taskers and have a unique commonsense, should they wish to engage themselves. They should be the change agents of tomorrow.”<\/strong>\r\n\r\n“We need to co-exist and respect women in their entirety,” elaborated the CoFounder & Dean of The Delhi School of Communication - Prof. Ramola Kumar. This was a strong belief that she endorsed. Tracing her ‘power-packed’ performance in the education industry and in the field of Business Communication, she has made a name for herself as a Communication Champion in both corporate and education sectors. In a dialogue with Shree Lahiri, she narrates her journey, the source of her inspiration, the future and more… \r\n\r\n<strong>Once you decided to venture out, how was the journey? What did you aim to achieve?<\/strong>\r\nThe journey was full of challenges – the field of the chosen programme was undefined in the minds of the target audience. Hence creating a basic understanding of the band-width of IMC (Integrated Marketing Communications) was itself a challenge.\r\n\r\nBeing a boutique, competition from larger institutes was also a challenge. But, building and instilling quality content value and valuable professional attitude was our unique selling proposition.\r\n\r\n<strong>Where did the inspiration emerge from?<\/strong>\r\nInspiration came from the confines of a daily routine to one where the mind could envision each child’s future, on his\/her life’s canvas. The joy of guiding, mentoring keeping in mind each student’s unique abilities and allowing thought processes to evolve individually and collectively. Another significant factor was - igniting creative energy to guide the spirit through the unknown.\r\n\r\n<strong>Could you tell us about the challenges that created any blockages along the way?<\/strong>\r\nThere were many challenges along the road like :\r\n\r\n1) Creating a unique system with and without boundaries\r\n2) Intensely integrating theory with practice\r\n3) Helping a ‘late-teenager’ to evolve into a responsible “young adult”\r\n4) Constantly upgrading the technology, knowledge and methodology of teaching, and keeping in pace with industry requirements\r\n\r\n<strong>Do you think the current business scenario encourages women entrepreneurs?<\/strong>\r\nDefinitely. I feel women can be wonderful entrepreneurs. Even if it be a small body-shop salon, the challenge is to work and fulfill your ‘karma’. Women are multi-taskers and have a unique commonsense, should they wish to engage themselves. They should be the change agents of tomorrow. \r\n\r\n<strong>How do you envision the future?<\/strong>\r\n The future can be as bright as you wish it to be.  There are multiple options, different and new ways to work-from-home and be independent from the boundaries of systems. If one can earn one’s livelihood and eventually also help others build a better future – one’s life would have been lived well.\r\n\r\n<strong>Would you have any tips for someone starting out today?<\/strong>\r\nEnjoy the challenges life throws at you, be focused, remain grounded and give your best, and  you will keep reaching your set goals along the way.[\/ffb_param][\/ffb_paragraph_0]",

      "post_content": "Rashmi Patwardhan describes herself as a “professional with a fine blend of IT &amp; Fashion”. She set up Rush Me Fashions, after she decided to become an entrepreneur.  As she speaks about her journey to Shree Lahiri, she appears to be totally committed to the objective she had set aside for her enterprise  – “to offer an Indian traditional fashion in the most elegant and exclusive form to the clients”.\r\n\r\n<strong>1) Tell us a little about your Rush Me Fashions. How long ago did you start up? What has been your motivation and what do you aim to achieve?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nRush Me Fashions was started about 5 years ago. We started with an objective to offer some unique, exclusive dress material and dupattas hand-picked from all the corners of India. Although the boutique started with a traditional brick &amp; mortar model, my goal has always been to run it through e-commerce model.\r\n\r\nOver these years, Rush Me Fashions has constantly innovated and evolved. Currently, I feel proud that we have our own design unit, that creates original design and prints. Also, over 90% of our business happens through our online portal.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, we are looking to offer fashion accessories as well as readymade dresses. Also, there has been a constant demand for stitching and tailoring, so we are seriously evaluating those options\r\n\r\n<strong>2) Where did the inspiration come from?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWhenever I used to buy dresses, I always felt that I can make such (or better) designs or mix and match to make them more elegant. Often I was fascinated to do something utilising my instinct for fashion. Finally I gave in to my calling - to switch my career entirely to pursue my passion, something that I thoroughly enjoy doing today.\r\n\r\n<strong>3) How easy or tough has it been for you, as a woman entrepreneur, to set up and promote your business?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nSetting up and promoting your own business is tough – for a woman entrepreneur or otherwise. The start-up ecosystem in India is still being built. Although some efforts are put in by the Government, Incubation organizations and Business Networking platforms, we still have a long way to go. There are several basic challenges like - ambiguity in compliances, ease and availability of finances and so on.\r\n\r\n<strong>4) Do you think being a woman entrepreneur worked to your advantage or brought challenges to your path?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI have a mixed bag of experience. Being in the fashion business, plus being a woman - works as a great advantage for me. And, there has been excellent support from my family. Of course, a few things proved to be challenging – especially being a woman entrepreneur – like traveling alone at odd hours to remote places, getting acquainted with the legal framework etc.\r\n\r\n<strong>5)  Do you think women entrepreneurs support other women across the value chain of business? <\/strong>\r\n\r\nWell, I feel, it’s an individual value system and mindset that largely defines if the entrepreneurs share information and support other entrepreneurs. I personally believe in a free and open business environment. There’s a great value for entrepreneurs in collaborating and growing together.I found a few of our business associates and partners quite supportive and open. Although there are still many women entrepreneurs who are carrying the secretive, proprietary business ownership approach. This needs to be changed.\r\n\r\n<strong>6) What would be the top 3 things to watch out for if you're a woman looking to start her own business?<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>First and foremost, get rid of the thought that you have any limitations being a woman entrepreneur.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Secondly, take your business and yourself seriously. Never consider it a secondary or trivial activity.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Take risks. Be bold and make decisions. Keep progressing towards your goal, and you will eventually make it.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>7) What is the road ahead for Rush Me Fashions in 2018?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWe are trying different strategies like diversification, vertical integration in supply chain as well as making strategic partnerships. We are still a young company, and will have to weed out the things that do not work out. In this year, we are aiming to evolve our niche, and will focus on those activities and grow. The future looks full of promise, opportunities and well… challenges too!",

      "post_content": "<em><strong>Technology can become a game-changer for entrepreneurs; it definitely improves productivity and can help them save time and money<\/strong><\/em>\n\nIt’s ‘technology’ that is celebrated on National Technology Day which falls on May 11, 2018. Highlighted on this day is the fact that it is the anniversary of 1968 Pokhran nuclear tests. It also emphasizes India's technological advancements.\n\nTracing back the history, Pokhran nuclear tests were a series of five nuclear bomb test explosions conducted by India at the Indian Army's Pokhran Test Range. On May 11,1998<!--more--> India successfully fired ‘Operation Shakti’ missile at the Indian Army’s Pokhran Test Range in Rajasthan (the first among the five nuclear tests in Pokhran).\n\nTalking about this day, brings into the picture, a number of top Indian luminaries. It was significant that our late President Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, had led the test. Later, declaring India a nuclear state was Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. This made India the sixth country to join the ‘nuclear club’ of nations. Hence, since 1999, May 11 is celebrated as “National Technology Day”.\n\nAnd, coming to the present times, PM Narendra Modi tweeted about the significance of the day, saying - \"Greetings to everyone, especially our industrious scientists and those passionate about technology, on National Technology Day.\" \"We remain grateful to our scientists &amp; the then political leadership for the courage shown in Pokhran in 1998,\" he further tweeted.\n\nThe day glorifies the importance of science in day-to-day life and motivates students to adopt science as the career option. The day is important for scientists, engineers, planners and all others engaged in governance and nation-building. The ministry of science and technology coordinates different events. Many companies and individuals are awarded with National Technology Awards for adopting new technologies by the President of India.\n\nSo, it is important in today’s times, to invest in technology. Technology can become a game-changer for entrepreneurs. Technology definitely improves productivity and as far as entrepreneurs are concerned, it helps them save time and money. Some examples of technological advancements are - online accounting tools, website builders, cloud-based solutions and much more. The prospects that technology presents on a daily basis, shows businesses that they can achieve more, and in the process, make more money, plus have more time to focus on other areas in their lives.\n\nIf entrepreneurs are technologically equipped, it helps their businesses attract investors who will extend funds. And, for a startup founder, it is top-of-mind to get funds and stabilize the financial situation. In fact, raising capital can be one of the most difficult and tedious tasks for any entrepreneur. And, this process involves time, intelligence, creativity; and, in the long run, it does edge in a stroke of luck too.\nHowever, there are plenty of new technologies, apps, and websites that aim to help business owners build connections, find investors, and grow their brands. It just takes perseverance and the ability to tell a story and choose the right platform for your product or service.\nAt the end of the day, starting your own business is a complicated, difficult exercise. So, why not take advantage of various technologies in order to simplify your life? Investing your time and effort into technology can bring in many advantages. It can help you attract funding as well as improve and grow your company. This move will also lead you to sure-shot success. And, let me tell you, it may just about be the most valuable decision you have ever made, as an entrepreneur!!",

      "post_content": "Poonam Katyal, a government registered artisan and has worked with various departments at different levels. She<strong> <\/strong>has been creating<strong> “<\/strong>papier mache” articles for last 15 years. Originally she worked out of Jaipur, but after marriage, she moved to Delhi where she continued promoting the “Papier Mache” art. Currently she is running an art and craft academy in Janak Puri, New Delhi called -  Kalakriti Creations.\n\nIn a free-wheeling conversation with Shree Lahiri, she elaborates on how she started at the very beginning and the milestones crossed in her journey…<!--more-->\n\n<strong>1. Tell us a little about your enterprise. How long ago did you start up? How has the journey been and what did you aim to achieve?<\/strong>\n\nMy story started seventeen years ago in Alwar where I ran a small business of making and selling paper mache handicraft items. In early 2000 I decided to pursue my interest more seriously in artwork and moved to Jaipur. Although my parents wanted me to study subjects that would get me a steady job, against all odds I enrolled myself in an art school, after graduation. For more than two years, I apprenticed with local handicraft experts in Jaipur and learnt everything there was to be learnt about “papier mache”.\n\nIn 2006, I moved to Delhi to set up my own business of creativity and selling paper mache utility and decorative items.\n\nTo begin with, I would make items for my neighbours, friends and acquaintances and word-of-mouth and appreciation grew! More orders poured in and got into dealing with bilk orders for festivals, birthdays, and corporate events. Today, I can say with pride that I am a qualified, certified artisan.\n\n<strong>2. Where did the inspiration for setting up this business come from?<\/strong>\n\nAs a child I was interested in creating small logos or objects out of matchboxes. In fact, I used to make the best out of waste from anything and everything that was available at home! In 2000 I decided to pursue this as a profession.\n\n<strong>3. Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you?<\/strong>\n\nAs business grew I had to get workers who knew the handicraft – that was the biggest challenge!\n\nFor this, I set up a workshop in my own place and started engaging underprivileged women, who wanted to become financially independent by building a skill in the field of art and craft.\n\n<strong>4. Do you think the current business scenario encourages women entrepreneurship?<\/strong>\n\nI feel yes, because the Government facilitation in terms of finance and functionality is very much there today. And, women are being specially encouraged. I feel women entrepreneurs can handle business far better, because their degree of empathy is high.\n\n<strong>5. What are your future plans?<\/strong>\n\nCurrently, I am involved with an academy that I have set up called Kalakriti Creations – one of the best in West Delhi. I have a shop in the leading handicraft market – Dilli Haat. Plus I have a presence in online e-commerce portals too.\n\nI plan to move into Pan-India by giving out Franchisee outlets – so that I can reach out to customers all over the country. The idea is to get in touch with other states, since there is so much of richness and variety in their crafts.\n\nI also plan to participate in exhibitions overseas, plus I already have plans in place to visit China and France.\n\n<strong>6. Any tips for someone starting out today?<\/strong>\n\nBe customer-centric rather than profit-oriented.\n\nDon’t disappoint your customer, even if the cost outstrips your sales price and you have to spend an extra buck!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

      "post_content": "It seems they were destined to work together and make a difference. Here, we are talking about Sangeeta Murthi Sahgal and Rosita Rabindra, who had been colleagues and friends for over 30 years. They got together and started Diversity Dialogs, where the Mission is clearly defined:   “To help organizations reap the benefits of greater gender diversity and inclusion across all levels and help women take charge of all aspects of their lives so that they can build successful careers”.\n\n“Over the years we have shared our experiences and challenges as professionals and women who have grown to commercial and leadership roles in STEM,” shared Sangeeta. Plus they <!--more-->have also actively worked on global D&amp;I programs, coaching and sponsoring women to grow and translating that into a business leverages interest, passion, and experience.\n\n“We believe that the business case for diversity (of all types) and inclusion is so strong, that once companies understand its impact and benefits, their focus and drive to improve D&amp;I will create a demand for our services,” revealed Sangeeta, all charged up.\n\nHere’s getting up close with them as they chat up with Shree Lahiri about the journey, the challenges, the future ahead and more….\n\n<strong>1. How did the idea of becoming an entrepreneur come up in your mind? <\/strong>\n\nAfter working in corporate India across sectors, I wanted to do something that would have a larger impact on a larger number of companies. As diversity and inclusion is an area I am passionate about and there is a lot of work to be done in this area, starting a business that focuses on enabling organizations to reap the benefits of inclusion, was the logical next step. I co-founded Diversity Dialogs with a friend in 2016. As an organization we focus on the inclusion and increasing representation in the workforce of women, the LGBT community, different generations, and people-with-disabilities\n\n<strong>2. How has the journey been and where has this reached today?<\/strong>\n\nThe journey has been exhilarating and steeped in unlearning &amp; relearning. We have met with over 70 companies across sectors to understand their D&amp;I strategies, goals, &amp; programs, and have a deep understanding of realities and challenges faced by both organizations and minority groups. Over the last 18 months we have created an impact on people and organizations such as GE, Genpact, EY, Metlife, BT.\n\n<strong>3. How would you describe some of the challenges faced by you?<\/strong>\n\nAs an entrepreneur, one needs to be multi-skilled and understand all the functional and technical areas of the business, be resilient as there will be ups and downs, handle uncertainties and ambiguity. As our services are strategic, we need show leadership in all we do to be able to present to, add value and work with boards and senior leadership of companies.\n\n<strong>4. <\/strong><strong>What are some strengths that a woman entrepreneur should possess?<\/strong>\n\nI believe that women entrepreneurs and professionals need to build and leverage professional and personal networks, showcase their personal brand and improve visibility, socialize ideas to garner support, develop the ability to navigate biases and challenges, be resilient to stay the course.\n\n<strong>5. <\/strong><strong>Do you think the current business scenario encourages women entrepreneurship?<\/strong>\n\nI believe that the environment is conducive for men and women to become entrepreneurs. The government has also taken steps to encourage and enable women to become entrepreneurs.\n\n<strong>6. What are your future plans?<\/strong>\n\nWith reference to gender inclusion, our goal is to impact the lives of a million women over the next few years, by enabling organizations to create truly inclusive workplaces and working with women to take charge and grow their careers to leadership and board positions.\n\n<strong>7. <\/strong><strong>What advice would you have for someone starting out new?<\/strong>\n\nIt is critical that entrepreneurs have clarity of their product \/ service, the need being addressed or created, are open to making changes based on customer needs, being passionate about their business offerings, viewing entrepreneurship as a long-term commitment, and having a contingency plan. It is also essential that one has an involved and active advisory council.\n\n<em>(The responses are given by Sangeeta Murthi Sahgal but the basic thought is in sync with what her co-founder Rosita Rabindra feels about the issues raised.)<\/em>",

      "post_content": "<em><strong>Smita Tharoor <\/strong><\/em><em>is <\/em>the founder of Tharoor Associates - a training, coaching and organisational development company. Based in London, she is a motivational keynote speaker and trainer, and her passion is the unconscious bias and how it impacts on all aspects of leadership development. Backed by a rich experience of working in the UK, India, Europe, Asia and US she has an edge with her unique understanding of the expectations and needs of different cultures. Catch her in a conversation with Shree Lahiri as she opens up on her entry into the world of entrepreneurship, the challenges faced, the future and more...\n\n<strong>1. How did the idea of becoming an entrepreneur enter your mind? How has the journey been and where has this reached today?<\/strong><!--more-->\n\nIt was entirely by chance. My boss at the time told me he was retiring and would mentor me so that when the time came, I could apply for his job. That was an epiphany. Rather than being thrilled, I realised I didn’t want his job. Coincidentally, a friend of a friend was owning a company that was failing. He knew of my expertise in cultural &amp; behavioural change and organisational development. He offered me the project and there was no looking back.\n\nI work across the globe, Europe, US, India and the UK.\n\n<strong>2. What were the challenges faced by you?<\/strong>\n\nIn the early days the challenges were the travel as my youngest son was only 11. We live in London and I have no immediate family in the city. It was up to my husband and I to manage our time to be around for the children. Both of us were travelling on work, so those early years were a bit of a rollercoaster.<strong> <\/strong>\n\n<strong>3. What are some strengths that a woman entrepreneur should possess?<\/strong>\n\nAll entrepreneurs should possess drive, focus, ambition, humility and the knowledge that we don’t know everything, but we can get advice and support from others if we need to. Women often fall into stereotypical female roles at home, and find managing a developing business quite a challenge as they have to be very different people in different environments. It is up to us to empower ourselves by giving ourselves permission to pursue our dreams AND be mothers, partners, homemakers or anything else as well. It is about managing our own unconscious bias and challenging ourselves.<strong> <\/strong>\n\n<strong>4. Do you think the current business scenario encourages women entrepreneurship?<\/strong>\n\nThat is too broad a question. Business scenarios in different parts of the world and in different areas of work may have different responses. Certainly, working in the organisational behaviour area in the UK, India, US has been totally encouraging and supportive. I really don’t see it as the “business scenario” encouraging\/not encouraging us. It’s about how we manage ourselves and empower ourselves. It is easy to blame something or someone if we are not successful. How about taking ownership, learning from it and working on it?\n\n<strong>5. What are your future plans?<\/strong>\n\nI’ve just started collaborating as a key partner with e2ePeople Practices in Bangalore. e2e is a culture audit firm, specialising in Merger and Acquisitions. They are experts in People Behaviour Analytics and have been consulting across industries and countries for the last 8 years. Tharoor Associates’ expertise is cultural and behavioural change and we have also worked across many countries around the globe. I’m very excited about this new venture.\n\n<strong>6. What advice would you have for someone starting out new? <\/strong>\n\nHave faith and belief in yourself. We are often our own worst enemy. No road travelled is easy or doesn’t have pitfalls. Keep at it. And go down this road only if you really truly want to be an entrepreneur. As the American poet and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson said, “The best lightning rod for your protection is your own spine.”",

How did the idea of becoming an entrepreneur come up in your mind? How has the journey been and where has this reached today?<\/strong>\n\nI traveled with my son to exotic locales and soon discovered the extensive interest from my family &amp; friends yet inhibitions they had for these off beat places. I realised these places are out of their comfort zone and\/or they lack company for these trips. Even after working in a corporate setup for 7 years, I always wanted to do something for kids and consider myself a <!--more-->travel evangelist.

These trips are in tandem with popular school holidays.\n\nThe tours designed for kids have been formulated with all my travel knowledge and experiences of travelling with kids. The tours are proactive to keep needs of kids and concerned parents in mind. I understand the importance of age appropriate attractions and energy levels of kids and have devised itineraries accordingly.\n\n<strong>4. What are your future plans?<\/strong>\n\nI have a penchant for kid's destinations and aspire to convert all my experiences to trips through Little Passports.

      "post_content": "As told to Anahita Masters\n\n<strong>1) <\/strong><strong>Tell us a little about your disruptive professional platform Retired Not Out. How long ago did you start up? What has been your motivation and what do you aim to achieve?<\/strong>\n\nIn 2016, my mum retired after 35 years of working as a teacher and found that it was almost impossible to get any skill or experience-appropriate opportunities for people over 60. Those that existed were not easily accessible. This was what triggered the beginnings of Retired Not Out.\n\nRetired Not Out officially was launched in June 2017 and has evolved into a professional <!--more-->platform for people over 50 to find meaningful opportunities to work, learn and network.\n\nWe hope to achieve a change in the way retirement is viewed. Retirement is not a “best-before” date and there is huge social and economic merit in leveraging this talent pool. This is increasingly true as the world ages more rapidly than ever before (in the next 3 years there will be more people aged 60+ than kids under 5) and retirement spans extend to almost 30 years in some countries.\n\nSince we started we have grown into a 250+ strong community and placed over 30 people in full time \/ part time roles based on their skills &amp; experiences. And this is just the beginning.\n\n<strong>2) Where did the inspiration for setting up this business in Hong Kong come from?<\/strong><strong>\n<\/strong>\n\nEarly last year I moved to HK for personal reasons but wanted to give form to this idea. We did research with a university here to understand if the need for such a service existed and discovered that Hong Kong - being one of the most ageing regions in the world was absolutely ready for this. Unlike India where the median age is 34, in HK the median age is close to 50; 30% of HK’s population is set to be over 65 in the next 20 years and the workforce is rapidly shrinking.\n\nHence driving senior inclusiveness in the workforce has huge economic and social imperatives in HK.\n\n<strong>3) How has your experience been so far, as a woman entrepreneur in the country? Are there forums and platforms for women entrepreneurs to connect and support one another?<\/strong>\n\nHong Kong has a great network for women entrepreneurs. There are industry and entrepreneur associations to share, learn and seek mentorship. It is possible for people exploring different careers or business opportunities to find a mentor easily with several options such as mentor walks, coffee catchups available for accessible informal support.\n\nI also crowd funded successfully on a women-focused crowd funding platform here called “Next Chapter” which helped me get access to an amazing, supportive community of female entrepreneurs.\n\n<strong>4) How easy\/ tough has it been for you, as a woman entrepreneur, to market, fund and scale up your business?<\/strong>\n\nIn my opinion, starting a business is tough for any individual. You have to get out of your comfort zone, learn a lot quickly and pivot business models to get traction. For someone who never ran a business before I do believe one has to “fake it till you make it!.” However, most women entrepreneurs that I have met have one thing in common. They are in it for the long haul, unlike most male entrepreneurs who are open to quick exits. This makes traditional VC funding routes more complicated for women entrepreneurs - where quick exits are the norm. This is why less than 3% of all VC funds go to female founded companies.\n\n<strong>5) Do you think being a woman entrepreneur worked to your advantage or brought challenges to your path?<\/strong>\n\nI feel being a woman and a mum, gives me natural empathy which is crucial when it comes to building a community for seniors or running an enterprise with social sustainability at its heart. It also gives me the focus to be able to prioritise and be more results oriented.\n\n<strong>6) <\/strong><strong>Do you think women entrepreneurs support other women across the value chain of business? How have you impacted\/ supported\/ mentored the careers of other women through your venture?<\/strong>\n\nWomen do support women. I have had the luck of meeting some incredibly talented women who have opened up their knowledge and networks to me. Through Retired Not Out, I also support senior women entrepreneurs and help their businesses gain traction. I feel entrepreneurs understand each other well and help given is help received. The world is a small place and it always serves well to be considerate and helpful!\n\n<strong> 7) <\/strong><strong>What would be the top 3 things to watch out for if you're a woman looking to start her own business?<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Don’t be afraid to ask for what you want. Be it funds, help or resources. If you don’t ask, you don’t get.<\/li>\n \t<li>Don’t let self-doubt come in the way of what you want<\/li>\n \t<li>Learn what you don’t know and un-learn what is stopping you from getting to your goal.<\/li>\n \t<li>Don’t do it just for the money<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>8) <\/strong><strong>How has the support of friends and family played a role in your being a successful entrepreneur? How do you balance your professional and personal life?<\/strong>\n\nI couldn't have done this without the support of family. I have a 3 year old and my husband has been the most incredible pillar at this time. I’ve been working on this without generating my market value in income for about a year now; and he has given me the time, space and support to be able to invest in my company and myself. I work out of home and co-working spaces and around nap-times to make sure I’m not missing out on wondrous toddler years as well as my passion to create a world where ageless hiring will be the norm.\n\n<strong>9) What next for Retired Not Out, and for Priyanka through 2018?<\/strong>\n\n2018 will see us expanding our footprint, helping place more seniors in meaningful roles and building training programmes to upskill them. We will also be evangelising for policy change and drive mindset change in organisations to look at this talent pool with a new set of eyes.",

      "post_content": "As told to Anahita Masters\n\n<strong>Tell us a little about Rustic Art and where the inspiration to start a line of organic home and body care products came from.<\/strong>\n\nAt home, we always used natural substitutes to chemical based personal care products. It was a way of life in our family. That passion extended to friends, then to social circles until we decided to launch a line of organic soaps. One thing led to another and we founded the company in January 2011. It’s been an amazing journey since then!<!--more-->\n\n<strong>You’ve based the venture in Satara; any particular reason for this? Has it worked to your advantage to be in a relatively smaller city?<\/strong>\n\n<strong> <\/strong>I moved to Satara when I got married almost 3 decades ago. Being a passionate naturalist and environmentalist, I have been able to mobilise a lot of social initiatives here. Plus, a small town gives me the comfort of having a large network of people. That worked to our advantage when we started the business. I must add that social media has helped me connect with most people who we do business with. It has also connected me to a lot of other brands that are in the eco space.\n\n<strong>How has your experience been so far, as a woman entrepreneur? Are you a member of forums and platforms where women entrepreneurs may connect and support one another? Do you see any value in such interactions?<\/strong>\n\n<strong> <\/strong>It has been an amazing experience. I have met many inspiring people who are contributing to the sustainable lifestyle space in their own way. I have received support from so many people that I did not even know before Rustic Art was born. So, this has been one of the most fulfilling experiences for me and it’s has only just begun.\n\nI am part of many online communities for social businesses, eco lifestyle and sustainable businesses.\n\n<strong> <\/strong><strong>How easy\/ tough has it been for you, as a woman entrepreneur, to market, fund and scale up your business?<\/strong>\n\nI believe that as an entrepreneur, the journey is quite gender neutral. J There are same amount of struggles, learning, fire-fighting and successes. Of course, I have been lucky to have had access to people and communities that have helped Rustic Art grow over the years.\n\n<strong>Do you think being a woman entrepreneur worked to your advantage or brought challenges to your path?<\/strong>\n\nLike I said, the journey of an entrepreneur is quite gender neutral. I don’t think a ‘man’ entrepreneur running Rustic Art would have faced any less or more challenges. I did not have any direct business experience, so I have had to learn a lot along the way. And the same would apply to a first time ‘man’ entrepreneur too.\n\n<strong>Do you think women entrepreneurs support other women across the value chain of business? How have you impacted\/ supported\/ mentored the careers of other women through your venture?<\/strong>\n\nRustic Art has connected me to many entrepreneurs across various stages of their business life cycle. Some had a lot to teach me in terms of product ideas, feedback and business strategy. The others reached out to me because they wanted to start out in the organic personal care space.\n\nThe best part about being in the eco-lifestyle industry is that we are all in it to make a difference. There’s no competition and, in fact, it’s very comforting to exchange ideas and notes with another entrepreneur with same eco-sensibility.\n\n<strong>What would be the top 3 things to watch out for if you're a woman looking to start her own business?<\/strong>\n\n1)      If you look out, you will find people who will support you and teach you along the way.\n\n2)      Tell yourself that it’s possible to do whatever it is that you want to achieve. That way you will always find solutions to everything.\n\n3)      Have a problem-solving attitude.\n\n<strong>How has the support of friends and family played a role in your being a successful entrepreneur? How do you balance your professional and personal life?<\/strong>\n\nYes, absolutely. I started this business with my niece, who was 23 at the time we started the business. My daughter and son have helped me tremendously. My husband, who is a seasoned businessman, has been very involved in shaping this business. My brother and cousins have been actively involved and spare their time when needed. We often organize workshops on eco-friendly menstrual hygiene and all of my family members pitch in the way they can. We are all in this together!\n\nBalance comes from prioritising what’s important. That way, we don’t necessarily have to differentiate between work and personal life. It’s all part of my life and makes it whole. On some days work takes priority, on others, my personal commitments are on top of my list.\n\n<strong>What next for Rustic Art through 2018 and beyond?<\/strong>\n\nWe are setting up a new unit for scaling the production. All products are hand-made so to scale up, we will be skilling people from local villages to join us.",

      "post_content": "New Year certainly provides us the chance to celebrate.\n\nAs we enter the New Year, we get thinking - what are we going to do differently this year? It’s a great time to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses.\n\nFor entrepreneurs, a New Year is a milestone. It’s a great opportunity to take stock of where you are, figure out where you’d like to be and put an action plan in place to help get you there.\n\nThe entrepreneurial landscape is changing. All the energy and resources invested is not just in the celebration but also to focus on a fresh set of resolutions. But, what resolutions would <!--more-->you make if you want to grow your business and move ahead in the new year?\n\nAt this point, I recall the Bollywood film – 3 Idiots, where Rancho said - 'Pursue excellence, and success will follow.\" Perhaps this seems to be in the minds of entrepreneurs, as they step into a brand new year. And, it looks like 2008 will ring in a new era.\n\nHere are comments from women entrepreneurs on what are the resolutions they have set out for 2018:\n\n<strong>1. Ruby Sinha, Founder, sheatwork:<\/strong>\n\n<em>My vision as Founder, <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/sheatwork.com\/\"><em>sheatwork.com<\/em><\/a><em> is to spread the message of entrepreneurship to more women especially in the grassroots….they should become aware of the opportunities and incentives available to them as entrepreneurs.<\/em><em> So, I can say that my New Year's resolution inspiration is to make sure that entrepreneurship should become a primary focus and not just a part time venture for women.<\/em><em> <\/em>\n\n<strong>2. Farah Mulji, co-founder, Educartis, Angola:<\/strong>\n\n<em>In 2018 I plan to carve out for more time, consistently, for personal reflection and taking stock of all our wins at Educartis (big and small!)<\/em>\n\n<em>The entrepreneurial lifestyle is hectic and driven by milestones. Through my time at Educartis (and being a mom) I have learned that there is much value in appreciating the journey. I hope to do more of that this year - and encourage other female entrepreneurs to do the same.<\/em><em> <\/em>\n\n<strong>3. Shraddha Bhavalkar, Co-Founder &amp; CEO, GetSetGo Fitness:<\/strong>\n\n<strong> <\/strong><em>So, 2017 was the year of getting our foot grounded firmly. Now that our processes, infrastructure, market understanding are in place; in 2018, the focus is on expansion. We are launching in the international market. We have currently setup a branch in UAE. We are coming up with a whole new line of products including a mobile app. In terms of technology, we wish to be the first Indian company that drives cutting edge Research and Development in the Fitness space.<\/em>\n\n<strong>4. JuhiGarg, Co-Founder, ED Times:<\/strong>\n\n<em>2017 has been a good year for us with ED Times getting ranked as top 10 youth blogs worldwide, with we becoming official blog partners for movies like Bareily Ki Barfi, Tumhari Sulu and Kaalakaandi.<\/em>\n\n<em>I am now focussing on building tons of inherent strength and substance in my business and hope to achieve the eureka moment in 2018 for my startup. :) <\/em>\n\n<strong>5. Vijaya Eastwood, Founder, CribLife:<\/strong>\n\nMy focus is to build my business CribLife as the ‘go to brand’ for discerning customers accessing luxury.  As a country we are transitioning from a saving mindset to a spending mindset, so we have a whole gamut of individuals who are looking for exceptional experiences and there’s no one stop shop for access to all things cool. This gap is exactly what Crib Life was formed to bridge, and I hope to bring the service to a much larger audience this year.\n\nI also hope  to expand the CribLife  membership base by extending invitations to young people who have made a mark for themselves and are influential in their respective fields of work. I don’t mean to preclude other generations but I feel that CribLife is a service that can particularly assist in adding value to young entrepreneurs.\n\nI’ve been fortunate to find a young, passionate founding team and we’ve had a great time nurturing the company. I think that each day we live the kind of life that we purport to sell. As the business grows, I plan on building on our team with more driven and talented individuals with a keen eye for luxury. And of course, I hope we keep enjoying each day of work as though it were a day of play.\n\n<em>(Compiled by Anahita Masters &amp; Shree Lahiri)<\/em>",

      "post_content": "As told to Anahita Masters\n\n<strong>1. Tell us a little about your venture Superscribe. How long ago did you start up? What has been your motivation and what do you aim to achieve?<\/strong>\n\nIn this age of information and era of digital marketing, pull marketing takes precedence over traditional marketing more often than not. <strong>And pull marketing needs great content - not only to thrive, but also to survive. <\/strong>This is where Superscribe steps in.\n\nWe started off as <em>Superscribe Content Writing Services<\/em> back in 2009. <strong>We were one of the first digital content specialists in the country.<\/strong>At the time, our product offering was fresh, <!--more-->engaging content for websites, blogs, and reviews,aligned with online marketing strategies.\n\nIn 2016, the business evolved into <em>Superscribe Content Solutions<\/em>, where we have <strong>expanded ourbouquet of services to include content strategy, content marketing, and additional forms of c<\/strong><strong>ontent, including text, infographics, videos, and more.<\/strong>\n\n<strong>2. <\/strong><strong>Where did the inspiration for writing and content development come from?<\/strong>\n\nEver since I could remember, I loved writing in all forms - poetry, fiction, articles, speeches, et al. So, when the opportunity arose to write professionally, my curiosity was piqued. <strong>Today, we work with a team of more than 50 writers, editors, and infogr<\/strong><strong>aphic designers across the country.<\/strong>\n\nMy educational and professional background in Marketing helps me understand brands to make the content we create consumable by the target audience.\n\n<strong>3) H<\/strong><strong>ow has your experience been so far, with setting up anentrepreneurship business in Mumbai? Are there forums for women entrepreneurs to connect and support one another?<\/strong>\n\nMumbai is undoubtedly amongst the best cities in India to set up shop. There are a number of online forums targeted towards women entrepreneurs;however, I have found that many of them eventually go off-track and turn into platforms for members to market their products. There are a few goodplatforms focussed on the Bengaluru geography that actively support women-led start-ups.\n\n<strong>4. <\/strong><strong>How easy\/ tough has it been for you, as a woman entrepreneur, to scale up your business?<\/strong>\n\nI have never encountered gender-based discrimination from clients in the digital industry. As far as scaling up is concerned, the challenge lies more on the talent acquisition front.\n\n<strong>5) <\/strong><strong>Do you think being a woman entrepreneur worked to your advantage or brought challenges to your path?<\/strong>\n\nI would like to believe that people tend to be less aggressive and more courteous towards women which basically makes business conversations more civil.\n\nOne surprising fact, though:While this generation is all about feminism and women's rights, and I can see that many millennials care deeply about these causes, I have noticed time and againacross various women-led businesses, that even this generation prefermale bosses. There's an underlying sense of resentment when reporting to a female boss.\n\n<strong>6. <\/strong><strong>Do you think women entrepreneurs support other women across the value chain of business? How have you impacted\/ supported\/ mentored the careers of other women?<\/strong>\n\nThe marketplace would be utopian if they did! Unfortunately, this is not the all-encompassing case. While I have met some highly skilled and wonderfully supportive women on my journey; I have also encountered a sizeable share of ruthlessly ambitious ones.\n\nPersonally, I believe that every client, vendor, and employee that Superscribe works with should grow.When one of our writers decided to pursue her passion for baking, we helped market her startup. We also encouraged a much-valued writer to move on when she got a career-transforming opportunity in the CMO's office. I'm sure we did something right, as shereturned to work with us when she decided to change her job later!\n\nMany of our campus recruits approach us to seek guidance on their career paths and further studies. We also give complimentary referrals of our channel partners to prospects regularly to help them expand their business.\n\n<strong>7. <\/strong><strong>What would be the top 3 things to watch out for if you're a woman looking to start her own business?<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Never compromise on quality for profits<\/li>\n \t<li>Work with people who value your product offering<\/li>\n \t<li>Invest in good talent<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>8. How has the support of friends and family played a role in your being a successful entrepreneur? How do you balance your professional and personal life?<\/strong>\n\n<strong> <\/strong>Their support has been invaluable, irreplaceable!Without the support of my family, especially in the early years, Superscribe would have grown at a snail's pace.Besides, various members of my extended family and friends provide valuable vendor referrals that makes day-to-day running much easier.<strong>I have found that striking a balance is e<\/strong><strong>asier when you know your priorities, in ascending order. Aligning your life to meet them is a constant endeavour.<\/strong>\n\n<strong>9. <\/strong><strong>What next for Superscribe, and for Chintani?<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong> <\/strong>Actively increasing industries and geographies served<\/li>\n \t<li>Working towards making Superscribe<strong>the most preferred workplace for thebest talent<\/strong> in our industry; which will then work with us to deliver customer delight<\/li>\n \t<li>Constant renewal of skill sets to ensure that the team is updated with the latest standards in the English language, the current trends in audio-visual communication, and the most recent developments in the content industry<\/li>\n<\/ul>",

      "post_content": "Establishing her own business, was a matter of pride for Gina Joseph, Founder and Chief Designer, Zola India She shares “Zola India is a culmination of my creative ideas about jewellery\/wearable art. It draws from my many inspirations and appreciation of art, architecture and culture of India; the vibrant colours, textures and rich cultural heritage”.\n\nLabeling herself part crafts revivalist and part jewellery designer, she collaborates with rural and folk artisans across India to give their art a new lease of life through a contemporary form and expression. “With each piece of Zola, you wear thousands of years of history,<!--more--> folklore and experiences and stories of artisans from rural India,” she ensures.\nAnother feather in her cap – she was recently selected as one of the 15 entrepreneurs in the Milestone Maker’s India program, organized by Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center and Startup India.\n\n<strong>Here’s what she has to say:<\/strong>\n\nQ. How did the idea of becoming an entrepreneur strike you in the beginning? How has the journey been?\n\nI did my graduation in Visual Communication 10 years ago from Loyola in Chennai. I started off my career in advertising and then I was a journalist for about 5 years and then was part of the corporate world for 2 years and always been an appreciator of art. I did not have any specific training in jewellery design; it was more of a hidden passion that surfaced at the right time in my life. I think the literature is very important when you venture into anything creative. I took a break from work and did an Arts Management program from Dakshinachitra in Chennai; before that I had a peripheral knowledge about art. I appreciated art but did not the fine details about a painting or sculpture. So, while doing this program, as part of my Indian art project I created my first three pieces of jewellery. I was very fascinated by the temple women in Indian sculpture, that is the salabanjikas (tree huggers), madanikas and yakshis (goddesses of fertility) so I got them carved in wood and put it together with semi precious stones. The concept was 'to wear a piece of history on you'. If not for what I had been exposed to in my Indian art, western art, temple architecture and cultural studies classes I wouldn't have been able to start Zola and make it what it is today. Am very much an accidental entrepreneur who happened to meet the right people at the right time and that's how Zola came into being.\nIt's been a great journey with it's share of ups and downs and learnings. Zola has got a overwhelming response in the country and few places internationally too and I foresee a bright and long road ahead for the brand and for me as an entrepreneur too.\n\nQ. Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you?\n\nThe jewellery sector is a very competitive one and to make a mark for myself and build Zola as a strong brand will take time. When I started Zola, there was no mantra that I had planned out, I just focused on giving it my 100 percent and bringing in rural crafts into jewellery design was a new concept which got people interested. In the past year there have been instances where I’ve found exact copies of my work by ‘designers’, calling them out eats into my time and work.\n\nTo keep my Zola wearers interested for more, I keep exploring new arts and crafts and see how can give it a new lease of life in the form of jewellery. After all it's ;s more fun to wear a piece of art on you than hanging it on the walls of your house!\n\nMy biggest supporters are my customers, most of whom I can call friends today. They have not only encouraged me with each collection but also are my strongest critiques and that pushes me to my creative best every time. Most of them who started off with buying 1 piece of Zola, today own over 10 and that’s the best kind of support and love any artist can get. Always grateful!\n\nQ. Do you think the current business scenario encourages women entrepreneurship?\n\nIt's a great time for women entrepreneurs of our country to give wings to their ideas. From a market perspective, there is a demand for something new and innovative on a regular basis and if one can feed that need and maintain it, you have a bright future ahead. There are various programs\/ organisations and grants that back women entrepreneurs these days and if you have an idea that you believe will yield returns, give it your all and take the plunge.\n\nQ. How do you handle competition?\n\nThere are many designers across the globe whose work I look up to and be inspired. The key for Zola so far has been to come up with something fresh and innovative that grabs the attention of our current and future customer base. When I conduct workshops in rural parts of India, I completely cut off from my city life and people. Complete focus on the craft, material, artisans ideas and the history behind it and my surroundings, shape each and every piece that comes out by the end of it. There are many hardships but I thoroughly enjoy the process and wouldn't trade it for anything else.\n\nI think that is my USP for Zola and that's what makes each collection stand out and so loved by people. There will always be competition, but focusing on our craft and customer needs has helped Zola reach great heights.\n\nQ. What are some strengths that a woman entrepreneur should possess?\n\nI wouldn't answer this just for women entrepreneurs but every entrepreneur out there, these are primarily mapped from my own journey and experiences.\n\n• Be passionate about your ambition and ideas and give your 100 percent to it.\n• It's not necessary to have it all figured out when you start off, I did not even have a business plan till over a year in the business.\n• Keep yourself busy and see how you can better your product or service everyday\n• Be patient and don't rush yourself and others, there is always a better impact on your business when things are done with patience and perseverance\n• Listen to each and every customer and take criticism more seriously than compliments. The feedback you get on your work is important for your brand's journey ahead.\n• Be hard on your opinions and stand by them. if you believe in something do not let someone bully you or your ideas down.\n• Be intellectually rigorous and challenge yourself with something new on a regular basis. Having an active body and mind is the key to new learnings\n• Be positive and do what you can to spread that positivity around, with your team, customers, and people around.\n• Respect people who have lesser power than you. Some of my best ideas and dialogues have happened with people who I had nothing to do with my business, but being open and receptive to them gave me some great professional insights\n• Don't panic. In a situation of crisis, try not to panic and try and solve it in a calm and peaceful way. panic only leads to chaos.\nQ. What are your future plans?\n\nZola India revives age-old arts &amp; crafts by creating a decentralized network of local talent across rural India. Zola India creates sustainable livelihoods by preserving India’s heritage, discovering new forms of expression and sharing it in the form of wearable art to the world.\n\nTaking this forward, we one day want to create a global network of local talent that come together to create wearable are for women and men across the globe; each piece narrating a story of the craft, artisan and centuries of history behind it.\n\nQ. What advice would you have for someone starting out new?\n\nBelieve in yourself and your ideas. Be open to criticism and learning something new everyday from people around you. Be patient and keep giving your best, the world will surely take notice!\n\n(As told to Shree Lahiri)",

      "post_content": "Co-Founder, Educartis, Angola\n\nAs told to Anahita Masters\n\n<strong>Tell us a little about Educartis and how the platform works<\/strong>\n\nEducartis is an edu-tech platform that connects learners or prospective students, with educational course providers, currently in Angola and Kenya. It operates like an online classifieds platform where institutes offering courses in tertiary and continuing education can connect with students looking to upgrade their skills. We saw from feedback from some of the largest job portals across Africa, that prospective learners often aren't able to find the training they want\/need. Since the technology revolution has leapfrogged in Africa, it wasthe best medium to use to reach out and make an impact. Educartis is a technology platform that <!--more-->can be used by learners to efficiently and effectively search for the right course and enrol for them, be it a bachelors’ degrees, online course, skill certification etc. On the education providers’ side, it’s is a web-based application that helps them reach out to a wide-based audience, without investing in technology themselves.\n\n<strong>How did you get involved with the other co-founders and contribute to Educartis’ growth?<\/strong>\n\nI joined Educartis as a late co-founder in December 2016 after moving to Angola with my husband and then eighteen-month-old daughter. Interestingly, I too stumbled upon a very raw version of the platform in search of a course, which led me to meet with the then founders. They needed someone to develop the platform further, build a team and help with raising funds; a challenge that I was ready for after my previous experience in management consulting. The last year or so has been like raising two infants; my daughter and Educartis. From redefining the business model, to strengthening the bench to just raising our first round of funding, it’s been a non-stop journey.\n\n<strong>As a woman co-founder of a technology start-up, would you say, “<em>it’s a man’s world out there<\/em>”?<\/strong>\n\nUnfortunately, yes. At least in the technology world, I do feel that the space is male dominated. This became very apparent to me through the entire fund-raising process for Educartis, where I’ve sat through over 50 meetings across the table from serial entrepreneurs, all male, trying to build a convincing case for my start up. It does make you feel at times, like a miniscule minority.\n\nBeing based in Angola, I also see the need for more women entrepreneur support groups and networks to share experiences and guide one another. While there are a few online networks that I’m a part of, there’s nothing that can compare with meeting someone in your same situation, to share thoughts and challenges.\n\n<strong>You mentioned you’re a mother of a two-year old. How do you manage the equally challenging balance of home and work?<\/strong>\n\nIt’s not easy; and I’ve learnt along the way. My support system in terms of family, is in Canada and my husband and I had our daughter soon after we moved to Angola. Added to that, my husband and I are both entrepreneurs with demanding schedules and travel. I’ve learnt to take the support of our incredible nanny and to keep a few hours in the day aside, to spend quality time with my baby. I’ve also had the odd conference I’ve had to attend with baby and nanny in tow, so I could continue feeding. Last but not the least, I’m also fortunate enough to have some incredibly supportive co-founders, and of course my husband, who are on the same page as me when it comes to balancing work and life’s priorities. It’s not the easiest of tasks, physically or emotionally, but I’ve managed to push the envelope so far, and plan to continue to do so!",

      "post_content": "<strong><em>Highlighting the role of girls sheatwork puts the spotlight on – ‘empower girls’, for they are leaders of tomorrow! <\/em><\/strong>\n\nToday - October 11 has been ear-marked as the International Day of the Girl, since 2012.\nWhat is the significance of this day? The objective is to focus on and address the needs and challenges girls face. At the same time, this day promotes girls' empowerment and the fulfillment of their human rights.\n\nOn the International Day of the Girl, let’s celebrate the potential of every young woman to be a powerful voice in her community.\n\nInterestingly, the International Day of the Girl Billboard in Times Square, New York had the visual of the globe with the catchy hashtag: #GirlsBelongHere.<!--more-->\n\nThe female gender is gaining importance in almost all major spheres of life. The world of sports has seen a major transformation. We saw PV Sindhu  creating history, when  at the 2016 Summer Olympics, she became the first Indian woman to win an Olympic silver medal. Then in September 2017, she won the Superseries title in Korea. And, rightly so, she feels after cricket, badminton has got its due recognition as more people are playing this game.\n\nThen in cricket too, women came into the forefront - with the Indian Women’s team walking away with the World Cup.  And, as a result, interest in women’s cricket has seen a major surge and research reveals that the ICC shows the impact this summer’s Womens Cricket World Cup has had on fans. As many as 92% of sports fans in India believe they had seen an increase in media coverage of women’s cricket in the last two years. Across the five key markets surveyed, 65% of sports fans were aware that the ICC Women’s World Cup took place, which included a whopping 94% from India and 67% from tournament host England and Wales.\n\nIn politics we saw Nirmala Sitharaman take on the mantle of Defence Minister of India, making her the second woman to take on this role (after a brief stint earlier by Indian’s ex-PM the late Srimati Indira Gandhi). Then Madam Smriti Irani, the current Information and Broadcasting and Textiles Minister in the Government of India has been making news since she took up office.\n\nIn the workplace too, the woman employee has been rearing her head. The new mindset is changing  the workplace environment and new rules are being  re-imagined. Citibank doled out gifts to new mothers, and now offers childcare allowances. Other companies such as Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Hindustan Unilever run their own creches or have tie-ups with creche providers. The the question of menstrual leave has come up. It is prevalent in many countries – an attempt to synchronise work with women’s natural bodily cycles. Companies like Nike introduced menstrual leave in their code of conduct worldwide in 2007. Countries like Japan,  Taiwan, China, Indonesian and South Korea have the concept of menstrual leave in place, by and large.\n\nIndeed, we have come a long way in terms of gender equality. But, reality still is that the number of women in positions of power remain low. However, the road ahead looks bright!\n\nThe slogan – “Empower girls”, is indeed flying high. The world’s 1.1 billion girls are a source of power, energy and creativity. This year’s International Day of the Girl (IDG) marks the beginning of a year-long effort to spur global attention and action to the challenges and opportunities girls face before, during, and after crises.\n\nSo, on this auspicious day, do join us in wishing every girl a bright future.",

      "post_content": "On World Tourism Day that falls on September 27, I take a look at my journey that started five years ago.\n\nI started this tourism business in fact, accidentally. The background is like this - a family friend, living overseas, happened to visit Delhi - to attend a wedding. They asked me to suggest places they could visit outside Delhi and also asked me to help out with the bookings.\n\nAt that time, I had a lot of time in hand. In fact, I had just shifted from Bangalore, and hadn’t started to work. What happened then, was that I worked out a nice package for them to go <!--more-->to the interesting tourist spot -  Kumaon. I have visited the area many times, so it wasn’t a problem. It didn’t take me long to call and talk to the hotels and create a package. But, what I noticed was that I loved every minute of it. I got to travel around Kumaon, though virtually! I felt even better when they came back and told me how much they had enjoyed the trip. I felt as if I have had a great trip!\n\nThen I got thinking about this episode. I started to put together my thoughts. Soon my vision emerged, as to what is that I wanted to do as a profession. Travel is something that has always fascinated me. I have travelled extensively with my mother since the age of three. In fact, I would say that, travel is in my DNA. From making the itinerary, to booking hotels to checking for the speciality food and restaurants of the area…we used to plan everything, down to the smallest detail, before any trip. That is exactly the way I plan a trip for each and every guest that walks into my office.\n\nToday WF is 5 years’ young. There is still a long way to go but I can proudly say that WF has a  growing tribe of happy customers (guests) who come back to us again and again - because we provide them that extra personal experience which makes their holidays  memorable!<em> <\/em>\n\n<em>(Parbati Bhattacharya is Director of Wanderers Footprints)<\/em>",

      "post_content": "<strong><em>sheatwork takes the occasion of Daughter’s Day on September 24, to pay tribute to daughters and acknowledge <\/em><\/strong><strong><em> women to get inspired, so that they are empowered to live their dreams!<\/em><\/strong>\n\nInspire, educate, elevate. That’s what daughters need to follow. Make sure to celebrate with your daughter; her wisdom may far beyond her years, and her compassion and deep understanding of others often help to make her family’s life better day after day.\n\nGirls in today's society play an equally important role in family life (like the boys).  They create an impact in other areas of life as well. It's matter of living life to the fullest! My advice would<!--more--> be - be in the moment with your daughter and encourage her to move up in life.\n\nTraditionally, the Indian mindset was tipped towards sons and not daughters. The story in most households was that a male child was often preferred. And these expectations existed in every strata of society - it doesn't matter whether people are educated or not.\n\nAt this point I am reminded of the movie - THE GAME PLAN, where an NFL quarterback - Joe Kingman is happily living a bachelor’s lifestyle. He is a successful football star and has everything - women, money, and a good career. Everything is perfect for him. Then one day an 8 year old girl turns up at his doorstep, claiming to be his daughter from a past relationship. He tries but fails miserably at \"parenting.\" Eventually though, she gets him, (and his football team) wrapped around her finger! Joe has to play the game of his life and when he's injured, and his daughter comes out and gets him right back on the field. This highlights the positive influence that daughters can have on their parents and the world around them.\n\n<strong>Daughters can take charge and make the world a better place - as entrepreneurs\n<\/strong>Daughters can grow up independent and skilled, and can take up entreneurship. Women's entrepreneurship in India has evolved, and we find a vast majority of women entrepreneurs engaged in running businesses; and they now have a presence in almost all the prominent sectors of the economy. In order to make this transition, female entrepreneurs have worked hard and proved themselves.  We read and hear about the pace of growth of women startups in India.\n\n<strong>Need for women entrepreneurs<\/strong>\nIt adage goes – behind the success of every man is a woman! Today the scene has moved further highlighting the role of women. She works hard, uses all her ingenuity – to succeed, after setting up her own career or business. It is fortunate that their contributions are being recognized now. A strong woman understands that the gift of logic, decisiveness and strength are just as feminine as intuition and emotional connection.\n\n<strong>Daughters can create a climate to succeed\n<\/strong>Daughters do work hard to keep peace and joy in their families. They can be encouraged to become business entrepreneurs. Woman entrepreneurs know how critical it is to have the right people in their core teams. Success is always achieved when you have a team where each and every one has ownership. Teamwork is a crucial part of a business, as it is often necessary for the team to put in their best.\n\nIt’s worth the extra effort to find the right employees who believe in your company’s mission.  The big idea should always be solving real problems of people. And, no one knows it better than a woman.\n\nSo, encourage your daughter to take the plunge and walk into her own business venture and make it a success!",

      "post_content": "<h5 class=\"headingCol\">Entre Chat with Shreya DeMonte (Founder, Sugar Dust- Dessert Amore, Bangalore)<\/h5>\nAs told to Anahita Masters\n\n<strong>Tell us a little about your venture Sugar Dust – Dessert Amore.<\/strong>\n\nSugar Dust – Dessert Amore, is a dream that has finally become a reality. My aim was to combine delicacy and complete customization to create baking magic. We love to experiment and create a whole range of goodies from cupcakes, cakes, novelty cakes, desserts, brownies, breads to even healthy granola! We deliberately do not have a menu, and instead<!--more--> like to have an in-depth discussion with a client on what they would like their creation to be like. It’s complete customisation, that I don’t think many other can offer.\n\n<strong>When did the passion for baking begin? Any childhood inspirations, hits and misses?<\/strong>\n\nI’ve always loved baking. Since the time I was a kid, I used to help my mom in the kitchen. Well, a lot of the time I would just lick the bowls clean when she baked cakes. Even just watching her got me inspired!\n\nIt started off doing birthday cakes for the family and soon I was handling all the Christmas goodies for home. I used recipes which have been handed down from my mum and have been in my family for years.  In my recipe development stage, I try out the recipe at least thrice before it gets offered to clients. My family and friends are my taste testers – and they are brutally honest!\n\n<strong>Do you think being a woman entrepreneur in the baking business has worked to your advantage, or stereotyped you?<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>\n\nBeing a relative newbie in the market I have not faced too many hurdles till now. My clients have all been from word of mouth and social media connections. Whoever I have met have been supportive and always willing to give me a chance. That being said I have also come across people who just assume home bakers have an easy life. And it’s not true. The amount of work we put into each creation is immense, the quality you get and the ingredients we use are of highest standards. Unlike commercial bakeries we do not use any additive and preservatives. What comes out of my kitchen is a creation of love and a lot of effort!\n\n<strong>What would be the top 3 things to watch out for if you're a woman looking to start her own business?<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Value your work and time – A lot of bakers, and many other women entrepreneurs get concerned about pricing, and end up under-charging. Make sure you value and respect your time and skill, for only then your customers will too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Be willing to ask for help – Womenmight be good at multi tasking and sometimes we might take on too much and forget that friends and family are always there to help. Use them!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Take some “me” time – Passion may drive us, but take that time out to focus on you. If you’re working 24\/7, you are going to burn out. Take time out – half an hour a day, or once a week and do something not related to work but just chill.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\nA happy self = a successful business woman\n\n<strong>How has the support of friends and family played a role in your being a successful entrepreneur?<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>\n\nMy friends are the reason Sugar Dust exists. I have always baked and given them stuff. I remember clearly a friend calling me one day and lecturing me on how I need to start pursuing my dream and focus on this full-time. My husband is my engineer and accountant he helps me plan my cakes out visually and spatially and checks my math when it comes to costing! He does my midnight runs when I have sudden orders and run out of ingredients.\n\n<strong>What next for Sugar Dust, and for Shreya?<\/strong>\n\nI’m excited to see what the future holds – one order at a time!",

      "post_content": "All over the globe, the International Literacy Day is celebrated on 8<sup>th<\/sup> September every year. The implication is that on this day, in 1965 the World Congress of Ministers of Education met in Tehran for the first time - to discuss the programme of education at the international level.\n\nSignificantly, the UNESCO in its 14<sup>th<\/sup> Session in November 1966, declared 8<sup>th<\/sup> September as the International Literacy Day (ILD).  Since then, ILD is celebrated on 8<sup>th<\/sup> September every year. The key aspect of the observance of ILD is to rally public opinion in favour of the <!--more-->struggle against illiteracy. Actually, ILD is a forum to disseminate information on literacy and raise public awareness and highlight the significance of literacy for individual and national development.\n\nTalking of Literacy, first and foremost, the discipline of education comes to mind.  In organizations, a great deal of education is planned and implemented.  Here, the education system is right from the beginning, biased to promote employee skill sets rather than employer skill sets.\n\nWe can now, look at the “Saksham” initiative. Sheatwork was elated to be a part of NIELIT initiative “????-?? - Power of She” campaign to encourage entrepreneurship among women under Digital India. The National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology (NIELIT), a body under Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), Government of India had launched a unique initiative “Power of She” - aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship among women under ‘Digital India’.\n\nUnder this initiative, over 200 female students from NIELIT Centres spread across different geographical locations participated through the smart virtual classrooms that facilitates live interactive. This environment is designed to encourage young girls to take up training and employment opportunities to build a trained female workforce. Local businesses have engaged with the project to promote women-friendly work environments.\n\nAt this point, the concept of “entrepreneurial literacy” can be brought in, which is seen today as a necessity for the new age that has dawned upon us. In a fast-paced and changing world, actions that arise from opportunites are the ones that stand out. These in fact, have the best chance of becoming successful and productive.\n\nIn social and economic enterprenurial activity alike, the key element is the human one – entrepreneurs. We can say that particularly young entrepreneurs, play an important role in shaping the future through innovation. It is seen as a space that has some basic knowledge of how a business is created and managed. When you are entrepreneurial literate, and you are in the space of small businesses.  You can say, you are a student but someone who puts his or her learning into practice. You launch your idea, then move to market that idea; then you also constantly work to refine your business model. You then emerge as someone who makes sure your passion transforms into a profit center.\n\n<strong>So, what we can witness today, is entrepreneurial literacy<\/strong> in action. The journey to become an entrepreneur starts from real experiences that test your knowledge and skills and motivations. You need to be literate – education-wise, plus you need to have knowledge about the business you have taken up, and some financial and legal knowledge too – for these also need to be picked up by the entrepreneur. Professional knowledge is what will back you up. This is important because too many people who want to start small businesses lack critical understanding about financial matters including budgeting, taxes, balancing the cashflow, managing credit cards or lines of credit, and developing sales projections.\n\nPursuing <strong>entrepreneurial literacy<\/strong> is about the research you do, to find out all details, study the market -  as you prepare to start your business.   Real entrepreneurial skills come from your work and industry experience, and your willingness to continue learning.\n\n<strong>Entrepreneurial literacy<\/strong> is a must, if you have to become truly independent and not be burdened working under anyone. You can be your own Boss!  If you are on track to pick up the skills to become an entrepreneur, then you are on the right path. For these skills will empower everyone to not only to succeed in business but in turn, will also fuel the country’s economy.",

      "post_content": "<em>It was a tough decision she took, when she quit her job after ten long years, says Komal Garg, Founder, Plant People. But then it has paid off. In a candid chat with <\/em><em>Anahita Masters she explains how the journey has been.<\/em>\n\n<strong>1. Tell us a little about your venture Plant People.<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>\n\nI see Plant People as a larger entity than the venture itself. It’s not just about me and my team and the nursery. It’s about everyone who loves plants and wants to nurture them, and learn about them. Simply put, we are a bunch of Plant People seeking to connect with more Plant People. Nowadays, almost everyone I meet wants plants either for positive energy, for<!--more--> beautification, to stay close to nature, for going organic like with herbs, for gifting, even forindoor air-purification and many more reasons. Ifulfil this need in many ways - through my nursery by selling many varieties of plants, through my green décor services where I go and design specialised spaces for clients – be it homes, offices, restaurants or gardens, and through my online delivery service, which reaches the entire country. Our motto is Green Karo Scene! J\n\n<strong>2. When did the passion for plants and gardening begin? Any particular inspiration? Was there an “aha” moment?<\/strong>\n\n<strong> <\/strong>My mother has always been an avid gardener. And being an Army wife, she usually had a lot of garden space to play with. Added to that, moving from one state to another every few years – she ended up collecting all kinds of plants from various places and painstakingly taking care of them so that they adapted to their new environment. I remember mornings as a child, especially weekends, being spent assisting her with trimming the hedges, loosening the soil, sowing seeds of the season, harvesting the kitchen garden – the list is long!J I’ve inherited a lot of knowledge about plants and growing them from her. I’ve pretty much followed in her footsteps, in the garden so to speak, and felt the time was just right to turn this passion into a specialised venture.\n\n<strong>3. Do you think being a woman entrepreneur worked to your advantage or brought challenges to your path?<\/strong>\n\nIn this particular field, I feel being a woman entrepreneur has played to my advantage. The nature of my work has a lot to do with homes, aesthetics and of course, nurturing plants. My guess is that people have inherently felt comfortable working with a female energy to beautify their spaces with greenery and plant-based design.\n\n<strong>4. What would be the top 3 things to watch out for if you're a woman looking to start her own business?<\/strong>\n\nI am sure things are overall much more conducive for women entrepreneurs in India today than they were, say, 15 years ago. That said, some of the issues I face are very much of an expected nature and so very basic! For instance, I source my plants from all over the country and I like to handpick each one of them. Most of the time, I travel to the suppliers that are all far away from cities. Needless to say, it’s always a challenge travelling alone.\n\nApart from that, of course, all kinds of people trying to arm-twist you, mistaking you for being soft\/ weak just because you’re a woman – right from suppliers to labour to sometimes even clients.\n\nAnother thing – in our society, where it’s still considered an ‘option’ for a woman to work or earn her own living, it can be quite a high to be running one’s own business (somewhat successfully, if I may add :P) and can get you carried away or lead you to become arrogant. To stay grounded, to stay humble and stay focussed is very, very important.\n\n<strong>5. How has the support of friends and family played a role in your being a successful entrepreneur?<\/strong><strong> <\/strong>\n\nMy family probably had more than a few nervous discussions over my plans since I started Plant People (:P). Quitting a profession I’ve worked in for over 10 years… Putting in most of my savings into a new business…I’m sure they had their concerns but those worries have never turned into discouragement on their part. In fact, they’ve shared my excitement over each and every project so far and have passed on tonnes of good vibes. Everyone around me is well aware of my passion and have seen the potential in Plant People. Friends and family alike, have played a huge role right from being my first few customers to spreading the word about Plant People on social media, and lending a hand whenever I needed that extra support. All in all, I’ve been quite fortunate to have the support system that I’ve got.\n\n<strong>6. What next for Plant People and Komal?<\/strong>\n\nI could go on and on with this one as there are SO MANY immediate next steps I have in mind – right from opening our Garden Store (very soon), to influencing corporate gifting to go green, from setting up small scale botanical gardens for people so they can organically grow (at least some of) the food they consume, to buying farm land as soon as possible…! J\n\nBut if you ask me about my ultimate aim through Plant People, here goes…\n\nI hashtag a lot of Plant People’s Instagram posts as ‘#greenstartup’. In the long run, I intend for Plant People to be an organisation that would make a real, tangible difference to the environment for the better. I believe thatit’s not the government’s responsibility alone – it’s mine, yours and everyone else’s too. It may sound ambitious right now, but I’m constantly working on ideas to make it a reality. My father, during his serving days in the Army, commanded an ecological battalion in Rajasthan, some 100 kms away from Bikaner, in the middle of nowhere, where his battalion planted 18 lakh trees during his 3 year tenure alone, with a hundred per cent survival rate in the desert! And they saw the rainfall in that area increase within his tenure itself! That’s inspiration as well as encouragement for me - if just 3 years of sustained effort could do that, the possibilities are endless, exciting and so REAL! And I’m hell-bent on making it happen.",

More than 9 million American firms are owned by women, employing 8 million people and generating  a whopping $1.5 trillion in sales (that’s almost 68% of India’s GDP!), according to 2015 data from National Association of Women Business Owners.\n\nIn India, even after seven decades of freedom the situation is far from comforting. Women workers form small percentages of the total workforce and in entrepreneurship, it’s still seen<!--more--> as a `male domain’. According to the National Sample Survey Organisation, only 14% business establishments in India are run by women and most of these are small scale industries in what’s seen as women centric enterprises - like tailoring, selling  handicrafts or making and selling confectionery.\n\nAnd more surprisingly, in the last 25 years there has been only one woman founded company which was listed on the stock exchanges and that’s Kiran Mazumdar Shaw’s Biocon. This doesn’t speak well at all ‘about the ecosystem to encourage women or even steps taken to boost more women entrepreneurs.\n\nNot surprisingly India ranks abysmally low in various global indices on women in labour force or entrepreneurship. India’s Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) for working women is 27%, just a shade better than that of Pakistan and Afghanistan. India ranks 70 out of 77 countries on the Female Entrepreneurship Index (FEI) for 2015. The UK based think tank, FEI is part of the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Institute (GEDI). And India ranked 49 out of 54 countries in Women Business Ownership index. Even Bangladesh, Uganda and Vietnam have higher percentage of women businesses than India has.\n\nCan a change happen? In today’s technology driven world it’s not difficult for change to happen. There are businesses that can be done close to or at home, offer flexible hours by using technology tools smartly. Even in the hyper active startup world there are plenty of opportunities for women entrepreneurs. In fact there are a few women who are challenging stereotypes and breaking the glass ceiling to become new age business women. These early starters are doing a lot to turn the prism of scrutiny, evaluation and decision-making in the startup investing ecosystem away from gender to business.\n\nBut, there’s a long way to go to build gender parity. There are plenty of issues or should we say excuses. There are very few venture funding firms run by women and hence even fewer women are able to get funding. The male dominated investing firms are more concerned about future of businesses started by women — what will happen after marriage, kids — than about going into merit of the idea. Though there is a small change — at least the number of women entrepreneurs looking for funding has gone up. Angel networks in Delhi NCR get about 350 ideas a month seeking angel funding. In 2014 around 5-6% of these were women-led and in 2016 that's jumped to 14-15%.\n\nThese ideas are coming from multiple areas — often what were traditionally thought as male domains —  like drug trials, water, technology, apps, and even fashion and beauty products. Most women founders are below 35 years of age. The good part is that today often it’s not the family that’s averse to the idea of their daughters or wives running businesses but the world outside – mainly investors, business collaborators and so on.\n\nPerhaps that change will come soon. As women entrepreneurs are also battling history: since there are fewer businesses promoted by them, there are also fewer examples of businesses that have scaled up phenomenally. A growing presence of women in jobs across banking, technology, pharma companies etc augurs well for a changing ecosystem that’s looking more at ideas rather than who’s running those.\n\nThe need is to change orthodox mindsets. Make it easier for women to access seed and growth capital and build the right support network that encourages women. That includes mentoring opportunities for women to scale their ventures, access to new markets and even how to cope with failure. A lot can be accomplished and today the society should not hide behind lame excuses but encourage women to take up new roles. And stop comparing women led ventures to men led companies. At least now, 70 years after independence, making that small change in thinking will ensure that half the talent is not wasted away.",

      "post_content": "<strong><em>Sheatwork takes a look at the equality factor, on Women’s Equality Day - August 26 <\/em><\/strong>\n\n<strong><em>Equality has come to the forefront, with the question of “Öne India One law” that’s creating headlines today. Even with the triple talaq verdict, our PM Modi pointed out that the SC order granted equality. And, what could be more appropriate than to dwell on this topic, on World Equality Day!<\/em><\/strong>\n\nTracing the history of Women’s Equality Day, it was on August 26, 1920 that United States granted its women the right to vote. This day also highlights the equality of women both politically as well as socially. This right to vote was passed in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> Amendment to United <!--more-->States Constitution, though the amendment was introduced many years before in 1878. The President of US has been observing this day as Women’s Equality Day since the year 1972 and the resolution was passed in 1971.\n\nSecuring a woman’s right to vote is a part of civil rights movement led by women which began formally in 1848. Women were recognised as second class citizens earlier, which was highly deplorable. The movement was first started in world’s first women’s right convention, in New York.\n\n<strong>An important day in the history of human rights  <\/strong>\n\nThis day is important in the history of ‘Human Rights’ not only because it recognises women as first-class citizen but also gives equal status to women with men. The world celebrated Women’s Equality Day on 26<sup>th<\/sup> of August to recognize equal rights of women in all sectors.\n\nFor the progress of the country, it is important that women should be treated equally.  Evidently,  countries which are developed provide equal rights to women, and they contribute equally alongside with men - in efficient functioning and development of their country. Since women constitute 50% of the population, they need to be progressive. When women take active part in the economy, the country’s economy gets a boost.  Women should enjoy equal status in workplaces, libraries, organizations and public facilities too.\n\n<strong>Entrepreneurship and gender equality<\/strong>\n\nEntrepreneurship is a key factor affecting the economy of a country and development of women entrepreneurship is important, especially since half of the country’s population is constituted by women. Gender equality plays an important part in development of women entrepreneurship. Gender-related development includes inclusion of schemes and policies laid by the Government to support women and these schemes and policies encourage women to take up their own business ventures. They can enjoy loan with less interest, Government provides training through various national institutions, and Government also assist them in getting investors for their business.\n\n<strong>Organisations working towards gender equality                                <\/strong>\n\n<strong>1. International Labour Organisation (ILO)<\/strong>\n\nThe organisation runs a project named Women Entrepreneurship Development and Gender Equality (WEDGE) which promotes women’s entrepreneurship and assists women business owners to create employment opportunities, and achieve empowerment and gender equality. The project also works towards poverty reduction.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ilo.org\/asia\/projects\/WCMS_099683\/lang--en\/index.htm\"><strong>http:\/\/www.ilo.org\/asia\/projects\/WCMS_099683\/lang--en\/index.htm<\/strong><\/a><strong> <\/strong>\n\n<strong>2. United Nations Organisations<\/strong>\n\nIt promotes women entrepreneurship and gender equality around the world. UN’s other organisations like United Nation’s Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) also transmits the importance of gender equality and women’s empowerment around the world. <strong>UNIDO<\/strong> believes that “Educating and investing in women and girls has a multiplier effect on productivity, efficiency and economic growth.”\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.unido.org\/gender.html\">https:\/\/www.unido.org\/gender.html<\/a>\n\nOther UN organisations like <strong>UN women<\/strong> have taken out a report for 2016-2017 which clearly depicts the importance gender equality and women empowerment at the global level.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/annualreport.unwomen.org\/en\/2017\">http:\/\/annualreport.unwomen.org\/en\/2017<\/a>\n\n<strong>3. World Bank<\/strong>\n\nWorld Bank promotes gender equality. World Bank believes that no country, community or economy can achieve its potential or meet the challenges of the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century without full and equal participation of women and men, girls and boys. It works for poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldbank.org\/en\/topic\/gender\/overview\">http:\/\/www.worldbank.org\/en\/topic\/gender\/overview<\/a>",

      "post_content": "During the 2014 elections, speculations were high about the key demand of \"freedom without fear\" for women – how it would be affected if Mr Modi became Prime Minister.\n\nWe are wiser now. In his first speech, after he swept into the role and donned the mantle of PM,  Narendra Modi insisted that India's Parliament must protect women. He urged politicians to work together to protect women. “Governments will have to work strictly against this,<!--more--> else our own souls will not forgive us,\" Modi said and went on to add, “Respect for women, their security – it should be the priority for all 1.2 billion people.\"\n\nTracing the journey of women at a point when India turns 70, we do note positive changes.\n\nWomen came into the spotlight at the 2016 Olympics.  We read about how “India's female Olympic athletes lifted a nation's spirits”, as a leading daily put it.  As a first, female wrestler Sakshi Malik earned India the country's first medal of the 2016 RioOlympics with a third-place smooth finish. PV Sindhu becomes first Indian woman to win an Olympic silver medal, creating history with a stunning display of talent, power and grace. In fact,  PV Sindhu had taken Indian badminton, the country’s high-performing sport, many notches higher.\n\nBut, these two weren’t alone. Dipa Karmakar did miss out on a medal but won over all Indians, who were cheering for her with her performance in the gymnastics contest - coming fourth in the individual vault final. Her colleague Lalita Babar became the first Indian woman to qualify for an individual Olympic track event final since 1984. Another shining star in her field: Aditi Ashok, an 18-year-old from the city of Bengaluru, the youngest contender in the women’s golf contest again came into the spotlight.\n\nThe successes of these women, have won them the adulation of millions and turned the focus on the challenges they overcame to make it to Rio in the first place.\n\nThat was not the end of the story. The Indian Women’s Cricket team came onto the centre stage in July 2017, grabbing the attention of India. In a thrilling win, the Indian women’s cricket team entered the semi finals.  But, in the finals even though it was the team from England, who beat India by nine runs to win the World Cup, praises were heaped on the Indian women’s team  at  the very place that not so long ago shunned female players. Lord’s at London, referred to as the Holy Grail or Home of Cricket, drew a full house for the exciting game — another breakthrough in a women’s tournament!\n\nAs in sports, women have been making waves in business too. Today, women play pivotal role in management. They are not only educated, talented, confident, ambitious and career-oriented but they expertly juggle all tasks, achieving a perfect balance between professional and personal life.\n\nToday, with their multitasking ability, women entrepreneurs can certainly initiate, organize, plan and operate their business ventures (however big or small) efficiently. Confirming this,  someone has said that “the woman who is creative finds greater freedom to translate her creativity and ideas when she has her own enterprise. For those who are highly professional qualifications and those who are from a lower economic sector, entrepreneurship is a means of earning money and contributing to the family income. However the challenge for the larger sections of women in India lies in crossing the threshold, overcoming barriers and discovering their own potential and identity. The climate is more conductive today and time is right.\"\n\nSo, we have seen women branching out and starting their own business ventures, which have been making a mark in the business scenario.\n\nEmpowering women, improving their representation and participation in all walks of life, specially in the male-dominated world of business, is critical to demonstrate that women have the power to choose and define themselves. When female leaders globally get engaged more jobs are created. When they get involved in literacy, poverty eradication, healthcare, childcare, welfare support, family crisis centers support, women’s refuges, reforms in laws - things can lead only in one direction – to get better!\n\nYes, the world is a better place when women have the power to lead! Three cheers to ‘womaniya’ power!!",

      "post_content": "The Bombaykery is a self-funded dream project that took shape in October 2015 as a Cloud-Bakery; Pop-up, says Mitali Sahani, Co founder at Head Chef, The Bombaykery. “We started Bombaykery with the aim to provide quality desserts at reasonable prices,” she added as she recalled the starting point of The Bombaykery.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Q. Tell us a little about your venture Bombaykery.<\/strong>\n\nThe Bombaykery is a self-funded dream project that took shape in October 2015 as a Cloud- Bakery &amp; Pop-up. It’s a bunch of us that operate\/manage The Bombaykery – the three co-<!--more-->founders &amp; partners; MitaliSahani (Kitchen Production\/Innovation), Manhar Sabharwal (Finance, Purchase, Logistics) &amp; Karan Sahani (Marketing, Strategy, PR). The owning company name is Two &amp; A Half Bites – owing to the size of the goodies served &amp; the roles of partners. The Bombaykery brand is bold, fun and hipster-like, (not the typical pinks &amp; pastels expected from a bakery\/pastry shop); its abstract with a great sense of attractiveness. We started Bombaykery with the aim to provide quality desserts at reasonable prices. You’ll see that the menu r<a name=\"_GoBack\"><\/a>evolves around bite-size desserts &amp; savouries; serving up a variety of flavours &amp; textures for everyone to experience. A mix of French &amp; American baking techniques, Bombaykery’s flagship store is now open at DLF Cyber Hub Gurgaon, delivering across Gurgaon, Central &amp; South Delhi. We also specially curate menus &amp; goodies for weddings &amp; corporate soirees.\n\n<strong> Q. What was your \"light-bulb\" moment for the business? Is there a particular inspiration? <\/strong>\n\nThe love for desserts coupled with a dearth of quality desserts in the city drove me to conceptualize The Bombaykery. For me, Bombay is home! The brand is kind of an ode to the city. Bombay isn’t just another city, it’s a melting pot of culture, diversity &amp;flavors – it’s a way of life. It’s a big city with tiny spaces that exhuberates experiences. The brand aims to encapsulate these various experiences through its bite-size goodies. The menu also has influences of typical Bombay flavours – Cutting Chai, Filter Coffee, Tender Coconut, Kala Khatta (Blueberry &amp; Blackberry) Paanetc\n\n<strong> Q. Do you think being a woman entrepreneur worked to your advantage or brought challenges to your path? <\/strong>\n\nWhile there are close family and friends that truly continue to support and guide me, I would say being a female entrepreneur isn’t easy. The road-bumps are multiple and faced daily (from internal &amp; external stakeholders) when you are #BossLady. Have come across many situations where tones were not correct and discussions were condescending. But all this just keeps making me stronger.\n\n<strong> Q. What would be the top 3 things to watch out for if you're a woman looking to start her own business? <\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Find the right partner\/s is the most critical. If your riding solo – then surely have a sounding board at your disposal  ??<\/li>\n \t<li>Don’t listen to people who say “<em>You Can’t<\/em>” - Believe in yourself and don’t let anyone’s thoughts bog you down. Be Humble and Stay Hungry; Strive to do better each day<\/li>\n \t<li>Avoid engaging with negative people<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong> Q. How has family support played a role in your being a successful entrepreneur? <\/strong>\n\nFamily has undoubtedly been the biggest support during any of my ventures. My strongest support being my husband (who is also my best friend and business partner) always drives me to achieve more and continuously instills confidence in me. Besides that, my parents and close cousins\/relatives have always provided structured criticism and have given a helping hand in times of need\n\n<strong> Q. What next for Bombaykery and for Mitali? <\/strong>\n\nThe road ahead is exciting – new partnerships, new collaborations, new stores, new cities and probably a new country! I would personally\/professionally like to create a holistic environment for the bakery world – where I hope to not only serve goodies but also educate and train people in all aspects relating to the bakery business.\n\n<em> As told to Anahita Masters  <\/em>",

      "post_content": "Friendship Day is a day which is entirely dedicated to celebrate the bond of care, love, affection, trust, loyalty and much more. On this day, all friends can venture out to cherish the wonderful bond that they share with each other. Friendships have paved the way in the world of business to reveal cutting edge insights, and opportunities that have opened up for women entrepreneurs.On International Friendship Day, we@work examines the role of friends in our lives, especially as far women entrepreneurs go. What is the role of friends in your journey?<!--more--> So, go ahead and celebrate, empower and support women in business ... Celebrate the precious bonds created. As we know, social networking has indeed shrunk the world and erased borders. On the other hand, it has also reduced major life events into mere status updates or tweets. The face-to-face interactions seem lacking. But the joy of connecting is indeed, endless. So, the next time there is a success recorded in the job scene, or a promotion, instead of simply whatsapping or posting a congratulatory message, do step out, plan and meet up with your friends to celebrate. It could be just a coffee pe charcha or a pot-luck lunch over a weekend, but do give in to the simple joys of sharing a bond. And sometimes, life is a good enough reason enough to party! With International Women’s Day, do you need any further convincing to celebrate your women friends? Here’s what some women in business have to say:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Parbati Bhattacharya, Founder &amp; Director, Wanderers’ Footprints “I am lucky to have friends who have supported me in my journey...they trust me with my choice of place for making their holidays memorable. They also give an honest and practical review thus helping me to improve further”.<\/li>\n \t<li>Juhi Garg, Founder, ED Times “Friends have always been very encouraging and positive for me in my entrepreneurial journey. There are good days and bad days in any startup, but they make sure you stay logged in, and power through”.<\/li>\n \t<li>Shraddha Bhavalkar CEO, GetSetGo Fitness “I have been extremely lucky in this department. My life has been extremely unconventional owing to my personal and professional choices. Friends were the helm that rode me clear of any lows. It was not easy to accept the untraversed path I usually took, but my friends and family have been extremely supportive of me through this journey”.<\/li>\n<\/ul>",

Ironically, people listen to him intently!\n\nReaching out to people. Our solutions range from 99\/- per month to 7K for 3 months. This makes our target customer base very large. Without big money to spend in marketing, this is quite a challenge. We are addressing it by turning to social media, Search Engine Optimization and word of mouth.\n\nSoftware development. We make use of some very sophisticated software and it comes at a cost.\n\n<strong>Did you face competition? How did you handle it?<\/strong>\n\nOf course, we did. Still do. Right from the biggest cosmetic companies to the biggest gym chains to some small local players, everybody claims to give you a great looking body in record time.\n\nWe did not set out to handle this competition. Instead, we focused on building the right product. We crave to give you better health and better life. An amazingly sculpted body is just the by-product. We don’t try to get you there in shortest time. Instead, we ensure that once you reach yourgoal, you stay there and lead a fulfilling life. We also ensure that you are never denied of your favorite food because great food is a bliss!\n\nAlong with this, our company is backed with top of the line work ethics and focus on client satisfaction. Every client gets a customized attention and personalized solution. We are very keen listeners and make sure every client feedback gets due attention.\n\n<strong>How did you try to make your business offerings different?<\/strong>\n\nWe listened, we understood and we focused on generating real value. While health businesses in India are too keen to up-sell and cross-sell their products, our solutions are centered around people – their health, their budget and eating preferences.\n\nWe pay close attention to every client’s routine, their dietary habits, their health problems and device a custom solution. We also keep a tab on their progress. Our coaches receive elaborate reports on their progress and make decisions based on data. In addition to this, we do not encourage restrictive dieting and use of unnatural means. We help you establish a healthy relationship with food.\n\nThink of it as a premium, personal nutritionist plus gym\/home trainer service that could be afforded only by a select few, now available to an average Indian!\n\n<strong>What is your fitness mantra?<\/strong>\n\nKeep it super simple! If it is not sustainable, it is not right. People who crash diet and keep going up and down like a sine wave through the yeardo more harm to their body than good.\n\n<strong><em>Three ‘R’s of fitness:<\/em><\/strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Resistance training. Whether it be body weight or gym weights, try to catch at least 3 days of workout every week<\/li>\n \t<li>Rest. I cannot emphasize on this enough. If you want a radiant skin, maintain great energy levels and feel positive, rest is the key!<\/li>\n \t<li>Replenish. Drink at least 3 liters of water every day. Give your body the necessary macro and micro nutrients. It does not mean carrying a food measuring scale everywhere. It means listening to your body and eating in moderation and of course, indulging once in a while.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<strong>How are women placed today to take up entrepreneurship in India?<\/strong>\n\nThis question triggers the feminist in me. Let me not quote the likes of Indu Jain, Kiran Mazumdar or IndraNooyi. We all know what amazing personalities they are.\n\nLet me point you to something more abundant. Look around – from food to fashion to technology space, there are female entrepreneurs spurting everywhere and they are totally brilliant at what they do! AnkitaSheth, Swati Bhargava, Pranshu Bhandari; there is a name in every domain.\n\nDoes it mean the conditions for women are favorable for entrepreneurship in India? To be honest, I am not an expert and do not have data to validate that, but it sure seems the winds are changing.\n\n<strong> Any tips for women entrepreneur who are setting out on her journey?<\/strong>\n\nKeep it genuine, keep it honest. Focus on adding value. Do it because you love it. Remember – the road ahead is very demanding. The only way you will be able to sustain is with passion. Eve",

      "post_content": "<strong><em>Celebrating World Youth Skills Day on July15, we@work identified six skills that women entrepreneurs need to develop to keep afloat from Day 1<\/em><\/strong>\n\nPicture this. You’ve taken the bold step and have decided to be on your own. As you start the planning process, you get thinking about how to start your own business, as a woman entrepreneur. The first step can be to ask yourself, “What skills do I really need to have to succeed as an entrepreneur?”\n\nAt the onset, you will need a number of entrepreneurial skills to succeed in today’s competitive market – like some basic skills necessary to enable you to start, develop,\n\n<!--more--> finance, brand and market your own business. Besides, the skills may include - personal qualities, business and management skills. If you do not possess all of them right now, not lose heart.  You can develop them or polish certain skills that can help you become a <em>better<\/em> entrepreneur.\n\nToday, the reality is that women are opting to be entrepreneurs and are making inroads into the business scenario.\n\nHere are six basic skills you really must have to run any kind of business. Focus on these areas and they should lead you to success.\n\n<strong>1. Have a vision<\/strong>\n\nSuccessful entrepreneurs are visionaries, and they are able to spot opportunities. They have a clear idea of what they want to do. What’s more, successful entrepreneurs have the ability to transform that vision into reality. They go all out! Don’t shy away from the challenges, any fear or apprehensions, and focus on the sheer amount of work needed to get things done.\n\nApart form vision, a woman entrepreneur needs to manage things to succeed. She will have to manage a lot of people under her and also have to deal with clients, suppliers and investors. Confidence in oneself is another requisite to be developed, for – if you believe that you can achieve it, half the job is done!\n\n<strong>2. Communication skills<\/strong>\n\nIt would be extremely helpful if you possess excellent written and oral communication skills - to help you sell your products and services. You need computer skills – to make ppts, reports, proposals etc\n\nYou need to create a buzz about your business by talking and presenting to people your business. You need to write ads, press releases and story ideas about your business. Starting a business is a time to get out and aggressively market your venture. That’s the only way you can succeed.\n\nYou also need to be familiar with online communication skills, so you should become familiar with social media. You will then learn how to promote your business, leveraging social media. Plus, the more you educate yourself the better the entrepreneur you are. So, reading should be practiced on an everyday basis.\n\n<strong>3. Sales and marketing know-how<\/strong>\n\nSales and marketing are the two most important skills you must have when you plan to start your own business. A business is nothing if it does not have a customer-base, who will lead to revenues and profits, in the long run. To get customers, you must be able to market your business and possess the skills to drive sales.\n\nAs you plan your business, you must begin to think how to reach your target audience, meaning the people who may need your products\/services. This implies that you  understand the concept of marketing, and are able to use the tools. You must have a knack for understanding what people want, by listening to their needs, and then interact well with a variety of people.\n\nBe focussed, for once the entrepreneur has decided upon what she wants to do, she needs to focus on the start and the growth of her business. To focus she requires an ultimate plan and she has to go according to the plan.\n\n<strong>4. Ability to handle finance<\/strong>\n\nYou are in business to make money. Therefore, the most important skill you must have is the ability to handle money well. So, spend some time with a Chartered Accountant and legal consultant, to understand the nuances of financial and legal implications.\nYour finance knowledge should enable you to know how to spend the limited start-up capital that you have, spending only when needed. The more comfortable you are with numbers, the more confident you’ll be, and the better decisions you’ll make.\n\nSuccess in business is not limited to those who have a lot of financial resources in the beginning. If you are able to manage your cash flow well when the business starts to run, you will be able to survive the problems. Be resilient, for one needs to be comfortable with the ups and downs of business as it can never go according to the plan created. The entrepreneur cannot back out when the business is going down.\n\nThe most important thing is to always focus on the bottomline.\n\n<strong>5. Time management skills<\/strong>\n\nThe ability to plan your day and manage time, is particularly important for a woman entrepreneur.  You must have a clear idea of the things you must do and you must have the ability to multi-task.  You may have to type all letters and emails, double up as the marketing head, writing press releases, making sales calls, and also become an accountant. Lots of jobs for a woman entrepreneur to manage!  No, you don’t have to be a superwoman. You simply have to know how to manage time and prioritize your tasks.\n\nPart of having good time management skills is knowing when to stop and when to leave work, and switch to your role in your family ­as wife or mother or daughter. A good tip here  is - you must know how to keep a balance between your work life and home life.\n\n<strong>6. Network, network, network<\/strong>\n\nAs a start-up entrepreneur, make sure that you have developed lists of networks  that are related to your nature of business. You need to track any events like symposiums, panel discussions, award ceremonies, exhibitions happening in your town, so that you could attend and come face-to-face with the nature of the industry and also get to meet important people. You will also get familiar with the success stories and problems faced by fellow business personalities and how they arrived at solutions.\n\nYou will also need to source government-related connections and then build a rapport. This will make your journey slightly easier. Networking is an important skill an entrepreneur requires and, for building good networks, it is important that you are a good communicator as well.\n\nStarting a business is never easy, even if you have the perfect background and possess all the above skills, for there is no sure-shot way to ensure your success. But, developing these basic skills will, at least, make the start-up process slightly easier, giving you a greater chance of seeing your business grow and prosper!\n\nResources:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/aileron\/2013\/11\/26\/the-top-skills-every-entrepreneur-needs\/#686cd80376e3\">\nhttps:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/aileron\/2013\/11\/26\/the-top-skills-every-entrepreneur-needs\/#686cd80376e3<\/a>\nhttps:\/\/www.powerhomebiz.com\/starting-a-business\/entrepreneurship\/skills-every-entrepreneur-need-to-succeed.htm",

      "post_content": "On June 30<sup>th<\/sup> at the stroke of midnight, India’s biggest ever tax reform, Goods and Services Tax (GST) will roll out to replace multitude of taxes. The revolutionary tax reform promises to catapult India into a fast growing nation, with significant GDP gains, greater ease of doing business across the country, easier movement of goods and replace multiple state and central levies into a single tax. No wonder GST is dubbed as `one nation, one tax’. It will\n\n<!--more--> benefit everyone—large companies, small companies, start-up entrepreneurs and consumers. Ofcourse for the last category some things, like bikes, will become cheaper while others, like eating out, will become dearer.\n\nGST is one single tax on the supply of goods and services right from manufacturing to the ultimate delivery to consumer. Credits of input tax paid at each stage will be available in subsequent stage of value addition, which makes GST as a tax only on value addition at each stage and thus avoids multiple taxation. The final consumer will bear only the GST charged by the last dealer in the supply chain, with set-off benefits at all previous stages.\n\nTo put it simply, sales tax, services tax and central excise tax are paid at every stage from manufacturing stage and eventually leads to one tax being paid on top of another. This makes the cost of production too high. GST eliminates these multiple taxes (see table: What GST Replaces).\n\nMore than 140 countries use GST, with France being the first one to implement the tax and Singapore, Malaysia being more recent examples of countries that shifted to GST. In India, GST will apply to all states except Jammu &amp; Kashmir (J&amp;K), as the state enjoys special status and has its own taxation powers and laws, which do not follow central excise duty, service tax and VAT. GST is governed by the GST Council and its chairman is Union Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley.\n\nGST will have three components: one levied by Centre called Central GST (CGST), second levied by the state governments called State GST (SGST). The third will be in case of inter-state transactions and imports, called Integrated GST (IGST). The third will roughly be equally to the first two—SGST plus CGST.\n\nBoth the Centre and the state will simultaneously levy GST across the value chain, except on exempted items which include electricity and liquor. Tax will be levied on every supply of goods and services. Centre will levy and collect CGST and states will levy and collect SGST on all transactions within the state.\n\nThere are five GST slabs from 0 to 28%. For example shampoo and cold drinks seen as luxuries will be charged at 28%, eyeliner and bottled water will be 18%. Small restaurants will pay 5% and air conditioned ones 18%.\n\nGST is a significant step in reform of indirect taxation in India. Combining several central and state taxes into a single tax will mitigate cascading or double taxation. This will help in creating a common national market. The simplicity of the tax is expected to lead to easier administration and enforcement. From the consumer point of view, the biggest advantage will be in terms of reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated between 25% and 30%; free movement of goods from one state to another without stopping at state borders for levies like octroi and overall reduction in paperwork and improvement in tax compliance.\n\nManaging the complex architecture and the network will be the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN). It’s a non-profit organization formed to create a platform for all the concerned parties that is, stakeholders, government, tax payers to collaborate on a single portal. The portal will be accessible to the central government which will track down every transaction on its end. The IT network has been developed by private firms which are in tie up with the central government and have stakes accordingly. The authorized capital of GSTN is ?10 crore (US$1.6 million) in which Central Government holds 24.5% of shares while the state government holds 24.5% and rest with private banking firms.\n\nRegistration with the GSTN is necessary for doing business in the GST regime as businesses will have to upload monthly supply data as well as file return forms on this portal. Out of the 81 lakh existing assesses, 65.5 lakh had already migrated to the portal till June 25. And more will do in coming days to prepare for this revolutionary tax reform.\n\n<strong>Table1<\/strong>\n<table style=\"width: 811px; float: left;\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 179px; text-align: center;\"><strong>No Tax (0%)<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 161px; text-align: center;\"><strong>5% GST<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 165px; text-align: center;\"><strong>12% GST<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 163.389px; text-align: center;\"><strong>18% GST<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 139.611px; text-align: center;\"><strong>28% GST<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 179px; text-align: center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">On items including eggs, butter, milk, honey, fresh fruits &amp; vegetables, drawing, colouring books.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Services<\/strong>: Hotels, lodges with tariff below Rs 1,000 per night<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 161px; text-align: center;\">Apparel below Rs 1,000, footwear below Rs 500, frozen vegetables, coffee, tea.\n\n<strong>Services:<\/strong> Transport services (railways, air transport), small restaurants\n\n&nbsp;<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 165px; text-align: center;\">Apparel above Rs 1,000, packaged dry fruits, cellphones, board games like chess, carom, diagnostic kits.\n\n<strong>Services:<\/strong> Non-AC hotels, work contracts\n\n&nbsp;<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 163.389px; text-align: center;\">Footwear costing over Rs 500, biscuits, cornflakes, aluminium foil, tampons, camera, speakers, monitors.\n\n<strong>Services:<\/strong> AC hotels that serve liquor, telecom services, IT services, financial services<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 139.611px; text-align: center;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Bidis, chewing gum, chocolate not containing cocoa, waffles, sunscreen, washing machine, deodorants, shaving cream, vacuum cleaners, hair clippers<\/p>\n&nbsp;<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\nPS: above list is indicative and not exhaustive\n\n<strong>Table 2<\/strong>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"283\"><strong>Items Exempt from GST<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"355\"><strong>What GST Replaces (taxes to be merged under GST)<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"283\">Electricity\n\nProperty transaction leviable on stam duty\n\nPetroleum products\n\nAlcohol for human consumption\n\n&nbsp;<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"355\">Central Excise Duty\n\nAdditional Excise Duty\n\nService Tax\n\nCountervailing Duty\n\nOctroi &amp; entry tax\n\n[urchase tax\n\nLuxury tax<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

      "post_content": "Let’s face it being a woman entrepreneur is not easy, even with all the modern advancements balancing multiple responsibilities, such as business, children and household take a toll on your body, making you more prone to health risks. Besides these responsibilities, women go through pregnancy, hormonal changes, menopause phase as well. Here are few simple tips to\n\n<!--more-->help improve your health without consuming much time or effort.\n\n<strong><u>Say bye to stress<\/u><\/strong>: Physical health is directly related to mental health, so it can be said that a happy body comes with a happy mind. Here are some suggestions to distress yourself.\n\n1. Having a hobby helps divert your mind from day to day stress and might also provide you with some workout along with it. For instance, I like to practice martial arts as a hobby and trust me no negative thoughts comes you your mind when the guy is trying to punch you in the face apart from what is happening that exact moment. Find your fix and have fun.\n\n2. Make people laugh including yourself, as they say laughter is the best medicine. Laughter lessens stress, improves cholesterol, and boosts blood circulation and immunity that is why happy people tend to fall sick less often.\n\n3. Move out and explore places and meet people. With the rise of social media people are much more connected than ever, but the experience of a face to face conversation is much more refreshing. After all seeing Eiffel Tower in person is much better than on a computer screen.\n\n<strong><u>Exercise<\/u><\/strong>: If your hobbies do not provide you with a decent workout or you don’t have enough time for gym, workout doesn’t have to necessarily consume a lot of time. All you need to do is make time by  sleep 30 minutes early and get up 30 minutes early. The 30 minutes include preparation time, workout and relaxation time. Here is one of my many go to quick 10-15 min workout routine to burn 100 plus calories and give you energy levels a boost.  The following exercise has to be done in succession and without breaks (if possible), for a duration of 5 – 15 minutes as per your personal capabilities.\n\n1. Mountain climbers- 10 repetitions (5 for each side)\n\n2. Kneed or regular pushups- 5 repetition\n\n3. Simple crunches - 5 repetition (try not to bend your neck forward and look upwards)\n\n4. Knee to elbow (standing)- 10 repetitions (5 for each side with right knee touching left elbow and vice versa)\n\n5. Punches- 10 repetitions (5 for each side, simple punches in the air)\n\n6. Repeat\n\n*For any prior injuries consult your physician before attempting the workout.\n\nFollow the routine with 5 minutes of light stretching and 5 minutes of meditation for relaxation and recovery. For women shouldering so many responsibilities managing 30 minutes of your day should be a piece of cake.\n\n<strong><u>Marinating good posture:<\/u><\/strong> It’s said now a days “sitting is the new smoking”. So it’s important to know how maintain our posture and avoid health risks. Below are few pointers for the same-\n\n1. Keep the screen of your monitor in line with your eyes and avoid hunching forward.\n\n2. Keep the necessary accessories and tool like mouse and water bottle near you to avoid any unnecessary uncomfortable posture for your body.\n\n3. Keep your arms at about 90 degree angle for support you and aid a good posture.\n\n4. Provide support to your lower back and as it is most venerable and lead to hunchback posture.\n\n5. Don’t let your legs be suspended and place them comfortably on something.\n\n6. Try not to lean your head forward, as it leads to extra pressure on your spine, try and maintain a vertical alignment for your spine.\n\n7. You can always get off from your seat and take a small walk.\n\n<strong><u>Check your calorie intake:<\/u><\/strong> Not eating enough is equally harmful as over eating, so having a balanced diet is of the outmost importance. Avoiding food with high calorific values such as processed food should be minimized and healthy foods such as leafy green maximized (avoid excessive dressing which can lead to calorific values much higher than a normal meal). While indulging in sweets,  always remember “<strong>nothing tastes as good as looking good<\/strong>”. And, at times when you are not able to figure out if you are really hungry or just craving for something, here is a simple trick - Remember the food you didn’t really like and your mom made you eat it, if you are hungry enough to eat that you are really hungry.\n\n<strong><u>Sleep well:<\/u><\/strong> Lastly, emphasis could be made on having enough sleep. Sleep deprivation can make you lose or gain weight. It can also lead to plethora of serious illness over time like – heart diseases and lower down your alertness, reasoning and problem solving skills. Different people have different requirements for sleep and usually range from 6-8 hours per day. Make a point to get ample sleep everyday and if some home it’s not enough, researches has shown recovering lost sleep over weekend also helps counter negative effects. But recovering sleep over weekend should not be a primary strategy and should only be employed when required.\n\nHope the above given tips will help you move towards a healthier version of you. Always remember first steps are the hardest, so make it a point not to break your routine till it becomes a habit.",

      "post_content": "Here’s why Fathers are special!!!\n\nFather’s Day comes and goes every year. But, do we stop and wonder - how often do we acknowledge and thank our Fathers?\n\nIn fact, the third Sunday in June is celebrated as international Father's Day in 70+ countries. It is indeed, a day to celebrate and honour fathers and fatherhood. This is indeed, a good time to reflect on the long-term and irreplaceable value that dads add to their children’s lives.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nHere’s your chance – don’t miss out as it’s <a href=\"http:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/topic\/Father's-Day\">Father's Day<\/a> <strong>2017!<\/strong>\n\nA father’s role goes far beyond that of ‘breadwinner’ or head of family. If you ponder over this, it includes a strong influence on his children’s well-being, behavior and choices in life. Fathers should be honored and recognized for the powerful, positive influence they have on the lives of their children. In fact, they deserve such recognition not just on Father’s Day, but every day of the year! Let’s raise a toast – to all fathers!\n\nWe share some interesting tributes that some women entrepreneurs had to make to thank their fathers and make Father's day special on June 18! Read on…\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Vijaya Eastwood, Founder, CribLife<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n“I wouldn't be doing what I do now if it wasn't for my father. He truly believed a daughter could do just as much as a son, if not more”.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Ms Ruby Sinha, Founder, weatwork.in<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\"Fathers definitely are one of the strongest influencers for women.  My father always taught me to believe in myself and take up challenges….his values in life and family values have helped me a lot in being an entrepreneur and a working woman. From a young age when most parents would bring dolls for their daughters, he would buy me a lot of books on various topics (generally second-hand books from Kolkata’s famous College Street to keep with tight budgets). He even inculcated the habit of reading the newspaper daily in me.\nHe would treat me as an equal with my brothers, and encouraged me to play cricket, football with the boys. Even, when I grew up he believed I should have a career before getting married. He was always my biggest admirer and strongest pillar of support. His pride in even my smallest achievements have given me a lot of self-confidence and the urge to do better and try out different things!\"",

      "post_content": "<em>For Parbati Bhattacharya, Founder &amp; Director, her travel boutique <strong>Wanderers’ Footprints “<\/strong>is a passion, that started on a serious note three years ago”. It’s all about customising travel plans and destinations, she says. As her enterprise is in the business of providing customized travel experiences, she explains her target is – families, people travelling in groups and corporates. In short, both Indian and global discerning customers.<\/em>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<em>Parbati shares<\/em><em>, “I do not have any experience in the travel line. My experience is that I am very widely travelled, as I have been travelling with my Mom from childhood! So I have travelled all over India and the world too”. <\/em><em>Back in those days of the late 70s and 80s, it was indeed a courageous feat with very weak travel infrastructure across the country, she recalled. But even as a child, she used to help her mother in planning their tours, besides helping out in booking tickets and hotels. <\/em><em>And, what is her speciality, her USP, that sets Wanderers’ Footprints apart? She points out, “In India I try to promote ‘homestay’ tourism and offbeat destinations.”<\/em>\n\n<em>So, with this travel boutique, she is confident of going places. Here are some excerpts of the conversation we had:<\/em>\n\n<em> Q. <\/em><strong>How did you think about becoming an entrepreneur?<\/strong>\n\nIt happened by chance. I am a passionate traveller. I used to help my friends in planning itineraries and doing bookings for them...then I thought why not make my passion my profession......Though it sounds cliched ..so I took the plunge.\n\n<strong>Q. What are the challenges faced by you, as you were setting up your business?<\/strong>\n\nWell, the biggest challenge I faced initially was the fact that I did not have any formal training for running a travel business. Slowly, I learnt everything on the job. I think my travel experiences over the years that started from the age of three, when I went with my Mother to Darjeeling has helped me overcome the hurdles. A big challenge was also to understand the nuances of the business, such as accounting, commissions etc.\n\n<strong>Q. How did you try to make your business different?<\/strong>\n\nI think my business is different as I try to plan each and every guest's travel experience as if it was my personal travel plan. I try to understand the travellers' psyche, their interests and choices and then customise a package\/ trip for them. I try and paint a picture of the destination and its highlights in my guests' mind, so that they are totally informed and don't get any unpleasant surprises.\n\n<strong>Q. How do you feel women are placed today, to take up entrepreneurship in India?<\/strong>\n\nWell I think women are very well placed to take up enterpreneurship roles, given that they are very focussed and are tuned to multi task. The glass ceiling has been broken and we are taking the lead in all fields.",

Here are some excerpts:<\/em>\n\n<strong>Q. You are originally from Manipur with an international background. How has this helped you?<\/strong>\nManipur, where I spend 6 years as a young girl is a land of fascinating cultures and traditions. Delhi and the UK is where I live and work now with a good deal of international travel. The combination and exposure to these vastly different places make me appreciate, enjoy and adapt to the ever changing yet very small world.\n\n<strong>Q. How did the idea of becoming an entrepreneur come up in your mind? Where has this reached today?<\/strong>\nI grew up with a very strong leadership streak and was I guess always very confident of my abilities. I took charge of everything I was involved in. I knew very early on, that I like doing things my way and started my first business when I was 24 years old. Today, I am continually learning and developing and am super-excited with our new venture CribLife, a luxury lifestyle management and concierge business.\n\n<strong>Q. What were the challenges faced by you?<\/strong>\nLife is full of challenges, I've learned to accept them as part of life. The challenging times in life make you more resilient and help you appreciate everyday.\n\n<strong>Q. It was reported that you have a keen interest in contributing to the socio-economic growth of the region. How have you achieved this?<\/strong>\nThe North East is an ignored and forgotten part of this country, and the growth India is enjoying is not shared with the good people of this region. Having said this, it is an area of outstanding natural beauty and with immense potential. I haven't achieved much towards making a difference but I continue to try in every possible way I can.\n\n<strong>Q. What are your future plans?<\/strong>\nI plan to continue with what I am doing and in the process touch as many people’s lives and make as much positive contribution in whatever way I can. I am very excited to be part of India's economic growth and share the world of luxury and bespoke.\n\n<strong>Q. What advice would you have for someone starting out new?<\/strong>\nBe ready to take risk! Focus your effort and work hard, the first small steps are often the most difficult. Surround yourself with positive people and most of all enjoy the journey!",

      "post_content": "Ms Juhi Garg is Co-Founder, ED Times, which is described as “a generalist online youth media, blogging about things we need to know”. The portal exclaims that they “press the need for SMART &amp; QUIRKY content for the youth, which would help them form informed opinions on things that matters”.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nHaving started her career in PR, she took on various roles such as - India Partner at Edge International Inc, Head of Strategic Communications at FoxMandal Little and Online Communications Consultant with World Wildlife Fund, Switzerland.\n\nCatch Juhi, as she gets candid on her experiences that led her to turn an entrepreneur:\n\n<strong>Q. How did you decide on venturing out into the road less travelled - being an entrepreneur? <\/strong>\nI think I was always ‘entrepreneurial’ minded. After doing a couple of jobs, and growing swiftly in those profiles, I got the confidence that I can replicate this success in my own venture too.\n\n<strong>Q. What are some strengths that a woman entrepreneur should possess?<\/strong>\nWe need to learn when to give up a dead argument and see the bigger picture, instead of just squabbling over unimportant issues. It should be easy to work with women entrepreneurs and not a hassle at all.\n\n<strong>Q. Could you tell us about the challenges faced by you?<\/strong>\nThe biggest challenge for any entrepreneur is to be able to tide over the gestation period. Once you are able to do that, you can handle the rest.\n\n<strong>Q. What are the factors that added to your success story?<\/strong>\nConservative spending, calculated risk taking, building culture of the company, team building, family support, being very focused on our product being good i.e. our content.\n\n<strong>Q. What is it that inspires you?<\/strong>\nThe work schedule, routine, habits of famous entrepreneurs of the world.\n\n<strong>Q. Could you name a book that inspired you?<\/strong>\nThe Alchemist.\n\n<strong>Q. How would you like to describe your entrepreneurial journey?<\/strong>\nOne day scary, one day brimming with excitement.\n\n<strong>Q. Do you think the current business scenario encourages women entrepreneurship?<\/strong>\nI probably speak from an urban set up - here, businesses are not judged by whether it is run by a woman or a man, here the quality of your work speaks. If you're good at something, gender plays no role, and women, who can afford to let go of this tag, should do so for the benefit of other women entrepreneurs, who genuinely need the push this tag brings with it.\n\n<strong>Q. Any tips for someone starting out today?<\/strong>\nPlease don't get bitten by the unicorn, investor, VC, cash burn, projections propaganda. Think traditional style of Indian businesses. You spend 10, you should make at least 12, save 1, plough back 1. It's better to grow slow, but be sustainable from day 1!",
