The online discussion with its focus on unlocking the potential of women entrepreneurship in Bihar is the first in a series of webinars aimed at highlighting the state of women entrepreneurship across various Indian states, organized by Sheatwork.com, a one-stop knowledge hub for women entrepreneurs. Eminent speakers included : Usha Jha, President- Bihar Mahila Udyog Sangh and Founder- Petals Craft; Sanjeeva Shivesh, Founder &amp; CEO, The Entrepreneurship School; Himani Mishra, Co-Founder &amp; CEO, Brand Radiator; &nbsp;Soniya Sanjay Sinha, Vice Chairman, Frontline Business Solutions and Vice President- BJP Purvanchal Morcha and Ruby Sinha, Founder, sheatwork.com.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The panel agreed that many more businesses have embraced digital tools in the wake of COVID-19 and women need to understand and accept that such digital marketplaces can support their ventures. According to the panelists, there is need for women to be made aware of product listings, social media presence, GST requirements, aggregators, among other things to be successful businesswomen. The panel opined that the overall state of entrepreneurship in Bihar remains challenging and the biggest problem in taking advantage of government policies is that women at the ground level are not aware of the policies that exist. Changing the mindset to a pro-business mode is the need of the hour and adopting local resources to go global can be the mantra for success.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Addressing the webinar, Ms Ruby Sinha, Founder, sheatwork.com</em></strong>&nbsp;said, “Most of us are not aware of the various government policies/incentives for women entrepreneurs implemented by the central and state governments. In fact, according to industry reports, majority of women entrepreneur establishments in Bihar are self-financed. Only 5% received financial assistance from the government, while just 1% have borrowed from formal financial institutions. This inspite of the government announcing a Rs 500 crore Bihar Startup policy in 2017 and trying to completely digitise the process through the startup.gov.in website. Through a series of webinars, beginning with this edition, we are trying to highlight the state of women entrepreneurship across various Indian states and bridge the information gap.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Ms Usha Jha, President – Bihar Mahila Udyog Sangh, Founder – Petals Craft</em></strong>&nbsp;added, “Due to lack of exposure and communication skills, women entrepreneurs of Bihar have been unable to present themselves on a national and international stage. There is no dearth of skilled women here, but we are yet to tap their skills fully to empower them and develop a large section of society socially and economically. Women are half the population but their contribution to business as entrepreneurs has not yet received its due credit. I hope platforms like sheatwork’s&nbsp;<em>AatmaNirbharShe</em>&nbsp;can help address the gap in the system.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Ms Soniya Sanjay Sinha, Vice Chairman – Frontline Business Solutions, Vice President – BJP Purvanchal Morcha&nbsp;</em></strong><em>said,</em>“Major challenges that women entrepreneurs face in the state include family pressures, upbringing, society, and gender and socio-economic stereotypes. As soon as people hear that you are a woman from Bihar, you find two speed breakers in your path. You have to prove to naysayers that you are an empowered and a capable woman entrepreneur, even though you may be from Bihar. A strong-headed woman can beat all odds of the society if given the right amount of push and encouragement.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Mr Sanjeeva Shivesh, Founder and CEO, The Entrepreneurship School</em></strong>&nbsp;added, “Bihar is the land where the seeds of Republic was sown. Now it is time that we sow seeds of entrepreneurialism here. It is a big state full of talented people but continues to lag all other states in most economic indicators. The only way this can be altered is by large scale focus on building entrepreneurs who solve local problems. Let Bihar set a vision - to build one lakh new enterprises in five years.&nbsp; It is not easy. But not difficult either. It has the power to unleash a virtuous cycle of investments, employment creation and unsurpassed growth anywhere in history. Let women become the nebulous of such a vision for all around benefit to every section of the society. A broad-based inclusive ecosystem-based approach by engaging youth, business community, educators, investors, lower bureaucratic hurdles and right incentives should be the way forward.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Ms Himani Mishra, Co-Founder and CEO, Brand Radiator</em></strong>&nbsp;added, “When a woman determines to start her own venture, the challenges she faces are more on credibility of commitment and societal structure than real business problems. It is important for the State Government to formulate a woman-friendly business ecosystem. Some of these include relaxation in strict eligibility criteria, turnover capping and mapping the appropriate skill among women population based on their expertise. To the women folk, I would like to say that more and more businesses are embracing the digital route in the wake of COVID 19. So, one must work towards solutions which are future ready &amp; can sync with the changing times. It is not only survival of the fittest, but the one who adapts to change survives and excels.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The forthcoming editions of AatmaNirbharShe Entrepreneurship Dialogues across various Indian states will be focused on starting up your business, leveraging various government schemes and understanding finer details of entrepreneurship.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>For Further Media Queries:&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Shweta Sharma<br>Email:&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:shweta@sheatwork.com\" target=\"_blank\">shweta@sheatwork.com</a><br>Contact: +91 7838484850</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

In fact, going by current trends, India should have more than 200 unicorns (startups with at least $1 billion valuation) by 2025, many of them going public, but this growth story will be primarily led by men.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Interestingly, the report, based on a survey of 2,000 women across India including women professionals, students, start-up founders and business leaders, highlights that almost 48% of women in non-metros are eager to take up tech entrepreneurship as a career option vis-à-vis 23% in metros who’d like to pursue their own ventures. Women in metros often prefer opting for corporate jobs as a convenient career choice.

These include:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Access to capital- </strong>58% of the respondents highlighted the difficulty of raising funds and gaining access to capital in comparison to their male counterparts. Amongst women in metros, 38% of the respondents felt that access to capital in metros is one of the major barriers to taking up entrepreneurship.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Lack of infrastructure-. </strong>73% of women in non-metros feel that the non-availability of adequate infrastructure deters their move in taking up entrepreneurship. While 22% of women in metros feel that physical infrastructure is a problem for them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Lack of mentorship-</strong> 67% of women in non-metros adjourn lack of mentorship as another crucial factor in taking up entrepreneurship. 34% of women in metros also feel that mentorship is important and without a guiding light, it becomes difficult for them to shine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Lack of Talent: </strong>Although women from non-metros are inclined towards starting off on their own, finding the right skill set in smaller cities hinders their progress. 48% of non-metro respondents have attributed lack of skilled and talented team often stops them to pursue entrepreneurship in comparison to women from metros where 18% feel that finding the right talent isn’t a hindrance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Access to Technology: </strong>Despite an increasingly educated population, limited access to relevant business and technical resources is a major impediment in scaling the venture, with 74% of respondents from non-metros attributing lack of technology as the primary challenge. 24% of women in metros also opine that technology access is imperative for women entrepreneurs which can make or break their venture.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unveiling the report, <strong>Ruby Sinha, Founder, Sheatwork</strong> said, “<em>Women shouldn’t merely be consumers of tech but be creators of tech-driven products/platforms. It is for all stakeholders including venture investors, mentors and society at large to ensure that the startup ecosystem especially in the technology space is rich with diversity – not just of ideas but even more women turning entrepreneurs to ensure all round growth of the startup ecosystem.”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Faisal Kawoosa, Chief Analyst &amp; Founder, Techarc</strong><em> </em>further added<em>, “It is the first time that India has more women than men on record as per the recent data released by the National Family and Health Survey. With this, the need for diversity at workplaces and in industries have become more important. In times to come, we’ll see that the tech sector will welcome women in leading roles where they stand as an icon of power and creativity at the same time.”</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The key highlight from the report talks about how the entire ecosystem needs a revamp by making entrepreneurship gender agnostic.

Highlighting the need for gender equality in global diplomatic roles were women diplomats from various geographies at the inaugural BRICS CCI WE, Trailblazers Dialogues Roundtable on Global Women Diplomats: Breaking Barriers; Shaping<br>Global Affairs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>BRICS CCI WE represents the women’s vertical of The BRICS Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BRICS CCI) which promotes commerce and industry in the BRICS and other friendly nations.

Yet, intriguingly, a closer look reveals a vital truth – when women have a seat at the table, the odds of reducing instability and conflict improve significantly. The 2023 Women in Diplomacy Index speaks volumes, spotlighting a glaring gender gap, with just around 20% of ambassadors being women. The numbers get bleaker in conflict scenarios, where women's voices have been<br>notably absent from peace processes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In this charged atmosphere, Dr. BBL Madhukar, Director General of BRICS CCI, stirred the audience with a call for equality in education and representation. He emphasized, “In a world evolving at lightning speed, diplomacy remains the cornerstone of global relations, molding the fate of nations and the course of world events. Yet, one critical dimension remains underrepresented: the resounding voices of women. As women rise, societal walls crumble.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Echoing this sentiment, Shri R.K. Vishnoi, Chairman of BRICS CCI, pointedly noted, “The role of women in diplomacy is paramount. International committees, leaders, and the populace are united in the conviction that women bring transformative ideas to the forefront. Their presence amplifies our chances of resolving conflicts.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Kicking off the event, Ms. Ruby Sinha, President of BRICS CCI WE &amp; Founder of sheatwork,<br>eloquently stated, “As we celebrate the invaluable contributions women have made to diplomacy throughout history, let's also collaboratively strive for a future where gender equality and women's empowerment are seamlessly woven into our diplomatic fabric.” She added, “These discussions hold exceptional significance in a year when India leads the G20 dialogues, placing holistic and inclusive, women-led development at the forefront.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The roundtable gathered illustrious women diplomats, including Ms. Hagar Spiro-Tal, Deputy Ambassador of Israel to India; Ambassador Bizunesh Meseret, Deputy Head Of Mission at the Embassy of Ethiopia; Ms. Wathsala Amarasinghe, Minister Counsellor at the High Commission of Sri Lanka; Ms. Amaranta Vandeperre, Third Secretary and Counsel at the Embassy of Chile; and Ms. Jalpa Ratna, Chief of Field Services at the United Nations Children's Fund. The conversation was artfully guided by Ms. Shormishtha Ghosh, Governing Body Member of BRICS CCI. Amb. Manju Seth (Retd.), the former Ambassador &amp; Consul General of India, closed the event with a poignant valedictory address.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",
